This appears to be due to the file size (approximately 4.5MB) and the computational complexity of the audio processing operations.\n\n## Analysis Attempt Summary\n\nI attempted to perform the requested comprehensive audio analysis which would have included:\n\n1. **Audio Loading**: Converting the WAV file to a time series format for analysis\n2. **Beat Tracking**: Identifying rhythmic patterns and tempo using librosa's beat tracking algorithms\n3. **MFCC Extraction**: Computing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients for spectral content analysis\n4. **Chroma CQT**: Calculating Constant-Q Transform chroma features for harmonic content analysis\n\n## Technical Issues Encountered\n\n- **File Size**: The audio file is quite large (4,485,198 bytes), which may be causing processing timeouts\n- **Processing Complexity**: Audio analysis operations are computationally intensive, especially for longer audio files\n- **Tool Limitations**: The current audio analysis tools appear to have timeout constraints that prevent processing of this particular file\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo successfully analyze this audio file, you might consider:\n\n1. **File Preprocessing**: Use audio editing software to reduce the file size or extract a shorter segment\n2. **Alternative Tools**: Try using local audio analysis libraries like librosa, essentia, or aubio directly\n3. **Chunked Processing**: Process the audio in smaller segments and combine results\n4. **Format Conversion**: Convert to a different audio format that might be more efficiently processed\n\nI apologize that I couldn't complete the full analysis due to these technical limitations. If you have a shorter audio file or can provide a segment of this file, I'd be happy to attempt the analysis again.",

This appears to be due to the file size (approximately 4.5MB) and the computational complexity of the audio processing operations.\n\n## Analysis Attempt Summary\n\nI attempted to perform the requested comprehensive audio analysis which would have included:\n\n1. **Audio Loading**: Converting the WAV file to a time series format for analysis\n2. **Beat Tracking**: Identifying rhythmic patterns and tempo using librosa's beat tracking algorithms\n3. **MFCC Extraction**: Computing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients for spectral content analysis\n4. **Chroma CQT**: Calculating Constant-Q Transform chroma features for harmonic content analysis\n\n## Technical Issues Encountered\n\n- **File Size**: The audio file is quite large (4,485,198 bytes), which may be causing processing timeouts\n- **Processing Complexity**: Audio analysis operations are computationally intensive, especially for longer audio files\n- **Tool Limitations**: The current audio analysis tools appear to have timeout constraints that prevent processing of this particular file\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo successfully analyze this audio file, you might consider:\n\n1. **File Preprocessing**: Use audio editing software to reduce the file size or extract a shorter segment\n2. **Alternative Tools**: Try using local audio analysis libraries like librosa, essentia, or aubio directly\n3. **Chunked Processing**: Process the audio in smaller segments and combine results\n4. **Format Conversion**: Convert to a different audio format that might be more efficiently processed\n\nI apologize that I couldn't complete the full analysis due to these technical limitations. If you have a shorter audio file or can provide a segment of this file, I'd be happy to attempt the analysis again.",

This is actually quite common in central Beijing, especially around major tourist attractions like the Forbidden City, where parking is very limited and often restricted.\n\n**Parking Recommendations:**\n- **Public Transportation is Highly Recommended**: The Forbidden City area has very limited parking, and Beijing's traffic can be extremely congested\n- **Nearest Metro Stations**: Tiananmen East (Line 1) or Tiananmen West (Line 1) are the closest metro stations\n- **Alternative**: Look for parking at nearby shopping centers or hotels and walk/take public transport to the Forbidden City\n\n## Interesting Places Within 1km of the Forbidden City\n\nHere are the notable attractions and places I found:\n\n### **Historic Attractions**\n1. **Nine Dragons Screen (‰πùÈæôÂ£Å)** - A famous decorative wall featuring nine dragons\n2. **Well of Concubine Zhen (ÁèçÂ¶É‰∫ï)** - A historic well with cultural significance\n3. **Palace Museum (ÊïÖÂÆ´ÂçöÁâ©Èô¢)** - The main Forbidden City museum (entrance fee: ¬•60)\n\n### **Museums**\n- **Residence of Laoshe (ËÄÅËàçÁ∫™ÂøµÈ¶Ü)** - Memorial museum for the famous Chinese writer\n\n### **Nearby Hotels** (if you need accommodation)\n- **Red Wall Hotel (Á∫¢Â¢ôÈÖíÂ∫ó)** - 4-star hotel\n- **Grand Hyatt Beijing (Âåó‰∫¨‰∏úÊñπÂêõÊÇ¶Â§ßÈÖíÂ∫ó)** - Luxury hotel\n- **Renaissance Beijing Wangfujing Hotel (Âåó‰∫¨ÈáëËåÇ‰∏á‰∏ΩÈÖíÂ∫ó)** - Located on famous Wangfujing Street\n\n### **Practical Tips:**\n1. **Best Access**: Use public transportation (subway Lines 1 or 2) rather than driving\n2. **Advance Booking**: The Forbidden City requires advance online booking\n3. **Walking Area**: The entire area is very walkable, with Wangfujing Street shopping district nearby\n4. **Tiananmen Square**: Just south of the Forbidden City, also within walking distance\n\n**Recommendation**: Park at a hotel or shopping center further out and use Beijing's excellent subway system to reach the Forbidden City. This will save you time, money, and stress compared to trying to find parking in this heavily restricted central area.",

This is actually quite common in central Beijing, especially around major tourist attractions like the Forbidden City, where parking is very limited and often restricted.\n\n**Parking Recommendations:**\n- **Public Transportation is Highly Recommended**: The Forbidden City area has very limited parking, and Beijing's traffic can be extremely congested\n- **Nearest Metro Stations**: Tiananmen East (Line 1) or Tiananmen West (Line 1) are the closest metro stations\n- **Alternative**: Look for parking at nearby shopping centers or hotels and walk/take public transport to the Forbidden City\n\n## Interesting Places Within 1km of the Forbidden City\n\nHere are the notable attractions and places I found:\n\n### **Historic Attractions**\n1. **Nine Dragons Screen (‰πùÈæôÂ£Å)** - A famous decorative wall featuring nine dragons\n2. **Well of Concubine Zhen (ÁèçÂ¶É‰∫ï)** - A historic well with cultural significance\n3. **Palace Museum (ÊïÖÂÆ´ÂçöÁâ©Èô¢)** - The main Forbidden City museum (entrance fee: ¬•60)\n\n### **Museums**\n- **Residence of Laoshe (ËÄÅËàçÁ∫™ÂøµÈ¶Ü)** - Memorial museum for the famous Chinese writer\n\n### **Nearby Hotels** (if you need accommodation)\n- **Red Wall Hotel (Á∫¢Â¢ôÈÖíÂ∫ó)** - 4-star hotel\n- **Grand Hyatt Beijing (Âåó‰∫¨‰∏úÊñπÂêõÊÇ¶Â§ßÈÖíÂ∫ó)** - Luxury hotel\n- **Renaissance Beijing Wangfujing Hotel (Âåó‰∫¨ÈáëËåÇ‰∏á‰∏ΩÈÖíÂ∫ó)** - Located on famous Wangfujing Street\n\n### **Practical Tips:**\n1. **Best Access**: Use public transportation (subway Lines 1 or 2) rather than driving\n2. **Advance Booking**: The Forbidden City requires advance online booking\n3. **Walking Area**: The entire area is very walkable, with Wangfujing Street shopping district nearby\n4. **Tiananmen Square**: Just south of the Forbidden City, also within walking distance\n\n**Recommendation**: Park at a hotel or shopping center further out and use Beijing's excellent subway system to reach the Forbidden City. This will save you time, money, and stress compared to trying to find parking in this heavily restricted central area.",

Focus on one aspect at a time while maintaining the others, and always prioritize learning over winning individual games.",

While MCP promises seamless extensibility and rich integrations, it also introduces a substantially expanded attack surface: any plugin can inherit broad system privileges with minimal isolation or oversight. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of MCP security risks. We develop an automated static analysis framework and systematically examine 2,562 real-world MCP applications spanning 23 functional categories. Our measurements reveal that network and system resource APIs dominate usage patterns, affecting 1,438 and 1,237 servers respectively, while file and memory resources are less frequent but still significant. We find that Developer Tools and API Development plugins are the most API-intensive, and that less popular plugins often contain disproportionately high-risk operations. Through concrete case studies, we demonstrate how insufficient privilege separation enables privilege escalation, misinformation propagation, and data tampering. Based on these findings, we propose a detailed taxonomy of MCP resource access, quantify security-relevant API usage, and identify open challenges for building safer MCP ecosystems, including dynamic permission models and automated trust assessment.\\\\n\\\\nAccess Options:\\\\n- Abstract page: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06250v1\\\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.06250v1\\\\n- PDF version: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06250v1\\\\n\",\\n      \"annotations\": null\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"isError\": false\\n}', annotations=None)] isError=False"

We develop an integrated approach that combines transfer entropy networks, agent-based modeling, and wavelet decomposition to capture information flows across temporal scales implemented in the MCPFM (Model Context Protocol Financial Markets) R package. Our methodology enables heterogeneous financial agents including high-frequency traders, market makers, institutional investors, and regulators to communicate through structured protocols while maintaining realistic market microstructure. The empirical analysis demonstrates that our multi-scale approach reveals previously hidden systemic risk patterns, with the proposed systemic risk index achieving superior early warning capabilities compared to traditional measures. The framework provides new insights for macroprudential policy design and regulatory intervention strategies.

However, this human-centric design limits machine readability for large language models (LLMs) and deep research agents. We address this gap by adapting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to bioinformatics web server backends - a standardized, machine-actionable layer that explicitly associates webservice endpoints with scientific concepts and detailed metadata. Our implementations across widely-used databases (GEO, STRING, UCSC Cell Browser) demonstrate enhanced exploration capabilities through MCP-enabled LLMs. To accelerate adoption, we propose MCPmed, a community effort supplemented by lightweight breadcrumbs for services not yet fully MCP-enabled and templates for setting up new servers. This structured transition significantly enhances automation, reproducibility, and interoperability, preparing bioinformatics web services for next-generation research agents.\\\\n\\\\nAccess Options:\\\\n- Abstract page: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08055v1\\\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.08055v1\\\\n- PDF version: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08055v1\\\\n\",\\n      \"annotations\": null\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"isError\": false\\n}', annotations=None)] isError=False"

The study is a multicenter\\\\n  trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally.\\\\n  The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a\\\\n  control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and\\\\n  allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy\\\\n  proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm\\\\n  for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change\\\\n  would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background\\\\n  standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is\\\\n  learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety\\\\n  and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized\\\\n  subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will\\\\n  actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study\\\\n  closure or changes to study arms.\\\\n\\\\n  The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400\\\\n  subjects with a \\\\\"recovered\\\\\" status (per the primary objective). The\\\\n  primary analysis will be based on those subjects enrolled in order to\\\\n  400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity subgroup\\\\n  (those with baseline status of \\\\\"Hospitalized, requiring supplemental\\\\n  oxygen\\\\\" or \\\\\"Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring\\\\n  ongoing medical care\\\\\") is also of public health importance. Hence,\\\\n  enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20, 2020 to ensure\\\\n  400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important\\\\n  subgroup. With recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600\\\\n  to over 800.\\\\n\\\\n  Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are\\\\n  discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15,\\\\n  22, and 29 as an outpatient. For discharged subjects, it is preferred\\\\n  that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory\\\\n  tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research\\\\n  as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other\\\\n  restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the\\\\n  clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be conducted by phone,\\\\n  and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have\\\\n  laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by\\\\n  phone.\\\\n\\\\n  All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory\\\\n  assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma)\\\\n  research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Days 1\\\\n  (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized).

The search results include stories from various years, with some dating back to 2017-2019. This suggests that the Hacker News search might not be filtering for the most recent content effectively.\n\nHere's what I found from the available LLM and AI-related content:\n\n## Recent LLM and AI-Related Stories from Hacker News:\n\n**Current/Recent Stories:**\n1. **Show HN: AI-Powered Twitter Filter** - A new AI tool for filtering Twitter content\n2. **Show HN: AI/ML Weekly Digest** - An LLM-curated newsletter with AI highlights and sentiment analysis\n3. **Show HN: Harnessing LLMs for automated UI testing** - A project using LLMs for automated user interface testing\n4. **Nyreth Framework** - A symbolic language and cognitive substrate for AI development\n\n**Research and Development:**\n- **Parsel: An LLM framework** - Stanford research on automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms using LLMs\n- **Stanford AI Benchmark** - New benchmarking tools for understanding large language models\n- **Machine learning for earthquake prediction** - Recent applications of ML in seismic prediction\n\n**Discussion Topics:**\n- Questions about the exponential rate of AI progress\n- Debates about excluding certain bodies of work from LLM training\n- Discussions on AI as a potential threat to humanity\n\nUnfortunately, the available tools don't seem to provide access to today's most current news from major news outlets or real-time feeds. The Hacker News results appear to be mixing older content with more recent submissions, and I don't have access to current news APIs that would show today's specific LLM developments.\n\nFor the most up-to-date LLM news today, I'd recommend checking:\n- Tech news websites like TechCrunch, The Verge, or Ars Technica\n- AI-specific news sources like VentureBeat AI or AI News\n- Company blogs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, etc.\n- Social media platforms where researchers and companies announce new developments\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any particular aspect of LLM development or recent AI news?",

The Hacker News results appear to be mixing older content with more recent submissions, and I don't have access to current news APIs that would show today's specific LLM developments.\n\nFor the most up-to-date LLM news today, I'd recommend checking:\n- Tech news websites like TechCrunch, The Verge, or Ars Technica\n- AI-specific news sources like VentureBeat AI or AI News\n- Company blogs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, etc.\n- Social media platforms where researchers and companies announce new developments\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any particular aspect of LLM development or recent AI news?",

The framework's universality and transferability make it particularly valuable for practitioners who need to work with multiple types of information extraction tasks without developing separate models for each.\n\nThe paper represents a significant step toward unified NLP systems that can handle diverse tasks through a single, coherent framework rather than requiring task-specific solutions.",

In this paper, we propose a unified text-to-structure generation framework, namely UIE, which can universally model different IE tasks, adaptively generate targeted structures, and collaboratively learn general IE abilities from different knowledge sources. Specifically, UIE uniformly encodes different extraction structures via a structured extraction language, adaptively generates target extractions via a schema-based prompt mechanism - structural schema instructor, and captures the common IE abilities via a large-scale pre-trained text-to-structure model. Experiments show that UIE achieved the state-of-the-art performance on 4 IE tasks, 13 datasets, and on all supervised, low-resource, and few-shot settings for a wide range of entity, relation, event and sentiment extraction tasks and their unification. These results verified the effectiveness, universality, and transferability of UIE.\\\\n\\\\nAccess Options:\\\\n- Abstract page: http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12277v1\\\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2203.12277v1\\\\n- PDF version: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12277v1\\\\n\\\\nAdditional Information:\\\\n- Comment: Accepted to the main conference of ACL2022\\\\n\",\\n      \"annotations\": null\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"isError\": false\\n}', annotations=None)] isError=False"

The framework's universality and transferability make it particularly valuable for practitioners who need to work with multiple types of information extraction tasks without developing separate models for each.\n\nThe paper represents a significant step toward unified NLP systems that can handle diverse tasks through a single, coherent framework rather than requiring task-specific solutions.",

The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.\\\\\\\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in 1956. Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation. The U.S. government provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true.\\\\\\\\nEventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat. In 1974, criticism from James Lighthill and pressure from the U.S.A. Congress led the U.S. and British Governments to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government and the success of expert systems  reinvigorated investment in AI, and by the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise. However, investors\\' enthusiasm waned in the 1990s, and the field was criticized in the press and avoided by industry (a period known as an \\\\\\\\\\\\\"AI winter\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). Nevertheless, research and funding continued to grow under other names.\\\\\\\\nIn the early 2000s, machine learning was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry. The success was due to the availability of powerful computer hardware, the collection of immense data sets, and the application of solid mathematical methods. Soon after, deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology, eclipsing all other methods. The transformer architecture debuted in 2017 and was used to produce impressive generative AI applications, amongst other use cases.\\\\\\\\nInvestment in AI boomed in the 2020s. The recent AI boom, initiated by the development of transformer architecture, led to the rapid scaling and public releases of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These models exhibit human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity, and have been integrated into various sectors, fueling exponential investment in AI. However, concerns about the potential risks and ethical implications of advanced AI have also emerged, causing debate about the future of AI and its impact on society.\\\\\"\\\\n}\",\\n      \"annotations\": null\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"isError\": false\\n}', annotations=None)] isError=False"

The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.</p>\\n\\n        <h2>The Foundations (Ancient Times - 1940s)</h2>\\n        <p>The conceptual foundations of artificial intelligence can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Greek myths told of artificial beings created by craftsmen, while philosophers like Aristotle developed formal systems of logic and reasoning that would later become fundamental to AI development.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>The modern era of AI began with the development of programmable digital computers in the 1940s. These machines, based on abstract mathematical reasoning, provided the technological foundation that would make artificial intelligence possible.</p>\\n\\n        <h2>The Birth of AI Research (1950s)</h2>\\n        <div class=\\\"highlight\\\">\\n            <strong>The Dartmouth Conference (1956):</strong> The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in 1956. Attendees of this workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades to come.\\n        </div>\\n        \\n        <p>The 1950s marked the official beginning of AI as a field of study.

ÂÜ¨ÁìúÈÖøËÇâ (Winter Melon Stuffed with Meat) - 30 minutes**\n**Difficulty: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ**\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Peel winter melon and cut into 25cm long, 3cm thick slices\n2. Place melon slices in bowl, add 15g salt, mix well, let sit 10 minutes\n3. In another bowl, mix ground pork, minced ginger-onion, 5g salt, 5g cornstarch, pepper powder, and soy sauce\n4. Stir meat mixture clockwise for 2 minutes until well combined\n5. Rinse salted melon slices 3 times with clean water\n6. Roll each melon slice and stuff with meat mixture\n7. Arrange on plate around the edge, crack 1 egg in center\n8. Steam in boiling water for 15 minutes with lid on\n9. Remove and pour the liquid from plate into a pan\n10. Add water starch (25g starch + 50ml water) to the liquid, bring to boil\n11. Pour thickened sauce over the dish\n\n### **2.

        "response": "This is also not the painting I'm looking for. It seems the specific painting \"Corridor in the Asylum\" may not be in the Met Museum collection, or it might be titled differently. Let me search for more information about this famous Van Gogh painting from his time at the asylum.\n\nBased on my knowledge and the search results, I can provide you with information about the painting \"Corridor in the Asylum\" (also known as \"Vestibule of the Asylum\"):\n\n## \"Corridor in the Asylum\" by Vincent van Gogh\n\n**Background Information:**\n\n\"Corridor in the Asylum\" (French: \"Vestibule de l'asile\") is a painting created by Vincent van Gogh in 1889 during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, France. This painting is one of several works van Gogh created while he was a patient at this mental health facility.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- **Created:** September 1889\n- **Location painted:** Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum, Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, France\n- **Medium:** Oil on canvas\n- **Dimensions:** Approximately 61.2 √ó 47 cm (24.1 √ó 18.5 inches)\n- **Current location:** The painting is housed in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (though it didn't appear in my search results, possibly due to different cataloging or it being on loan)\n\n**Artistic Significance:**\nVan Gogh painted this work during one of the most challenging periods of his life. He had admitted himself to the asylum in May 1889 following his mental breakdown in Arles. The painting depicts the interior corridor or vestibule of the asylum where he was staying.\n\n**Visual Description:**\nThe painting shows a long, arched corridor with stone walls and a vaulted ceiling. The perspective draws the viewer's eye down the length of the hallway. Van Gogh used his characteristic bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors, even in this institutional setting. The work demonstrates his ability to find artistic inspiration even in the confines of the asylum.\n\n**Significance in Van Gogh's Work:**\nThis painting is part of a series of works van Gogh created during his time at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, which also includes famous pieces like \"The Starry Night,\" \"Irises,\" and \"Wheatfield with Cypresses.\" It represents his continued artistic productivity despite his mental health struggles and shows his unique ability to transform mundane architectural spaces into compelling artistic subjects.\n\nThe painting serves as both a documentation of his living conditions and a testament to his resilience as an artist during a period of personal crisis.",

It seems the specific painting \"Corridor in the Asylum\" may not be in the Met Museum collection, or it might be titled differently. Let me search for more information about this famous Van Gogh painting from his time at the asylum.\n\nBased on my knowledge and the search results, I can provide you with information about the painting \"Corridor in the Asylum\" (also known as \"Vestibule of the Asylum\"):\n\n## \"Corridor in the Asylum\" by Vincent van Gogh\n\n**Background Information:**\n\n\"Corridor in the Asylum\" (French: \"Vestibule de l'asile\") is a painting created by Vincent van Gogh in 1889 during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, France. This painting is one of several works van Gogh created while he was a patient at this mental health facility.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- **Created:** September 1889\n- **Location painted:** Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum, Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, France\n- **Medium:** Oil on canvas\n- **Dimensions:** Approximately 61.2 √ó 47 cm (24.1 √ó 18.5 inches)\n- **Current location:** The painting is housed in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (though it didn't appear in my search results, possibly due to different cataloging or it being on loan)\n\n**Artistic Significance:**\nVan Gogh painted this work during one of the most challenging periods of his life. He had admitted himself to the asylum in May 1889 following his mental breakdown in Arles. The painting depicts the interior corridor or vestibule of the asylum where he was staying.\n\n**Visual Description:**\nThe painting shows a long, arched corridor with stone walls and a vaulted ceiling. The perspective draws the viewer's eye down the length of the hallway. Van Gogh used his characteristic bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors, even in this institutional setting. The work demonstrates his ability to find artistic inspiration even in the confines of the asylum.\n\n**Significance in Van Gogh's Work:**\nThis painting is part of a series of works van Gogh created during his time at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, which also includes famous pieces like \"The Starry Night,\" \"Irises,\" and \"Wheatfield with Cypresses.\" It represents his continued artistic productivity despite his mental health struggles and shows his unique ability to transform mundane architectural spaces into compelling artistic subjects.\n\nThe painting serves as both a documentation of his living conditions and a testament to his resilience as an artist during a period of personal crisis.",

The search results are not showing the detailed product listings with prices in a clear format. Based on what I was able to gather from the search attempts, I can see that:\n\n1. **iPhone 16 series** appears to be available on Amazon with high purchase volumes (10K+ bought in past month for some models)\n2. There are various iPhone models available including iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 series\n3. The search results indicate these are popular items with good ratings (Amazon's Choice designations)\n\nHowever, I wasn't able to extract the specific pricing information due to the way Amazon's search results are formatted and displayed. \n\nFor the most accurate and current iPhone pricing on Amazon, I'd recommend:\n\n1. **Visit Amazon directly** and search for \"iPhone 16\" or \"iPhone 15\" to see current models and prices\n2. **Check specific iPhone models** like:\n   - iPhone 16 (128GB, 256GB, 512GB)\n   - iPhone 16 Plus\n   - iPhone 16 Pro\n   - iPhone 16 Pro Max\n   - iPhone 15 series (which may have lower prices now)\n\n3. **Compare different storage capacities** as prices vary significantly between 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options\n\nThe pricing typically ranges from around $429 for older/refurbished models to $1,199+ for the latest Pro Max models with higher storage, but I'd recommend checking Amazon directly for the most current pricing and any ongoing promotions or discounts.",

However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment forlanguage-guidedagentsthatis highlyrealistic and reproducible . Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forumdiscussions,collaborativesoftwaredevelopment,andcontentmanagement. Our environment is enriched with tools ( e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases ( e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon ourenvironment,wereleaseasetofbenchmarktasksfocusingonevaluatingthe functionalcorrectness oftaskcompletions. Thetasksinourbenchmarkarediverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4 -based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, thatcurrentstate-of-the-artlargelanguagemodelsarefarfromperfectperformance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress. Our code, data, environment reproduction resources, and video demonstrations are publicly available at https://webarena.dev/ . 1 I NTRODUCTION Autonomous agents that perform everyday tasks via human natural language commands could significantly augment human capabilities, improve efficiency, and increase accessibility. Nonetheless, to fully leverage the power of autonomous agents, it is crucial to understand their behavior within an environmentthatisboth authentic and reproducible . Thiswillallowmeasurementoftheabilityof agents on tasks that human users care about in a fair and consistent manner. Current environments for evaluate agents tend to over-simplify real-world situations. As a result, the functionalityofmanyenvironmentsisalimitedversionoftheirreal-worldcounterparts,leadingto a lack of task diversity (Shi et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2018; Misra et al., 2016;Shridharetal.,2020;2021;Yaoetal.,2022a). Inaddition,thesesimplificationsoftenlower the complexity oftasks as compared totheir execution in the realworld (Puig et al.,2018; Shridhar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2022a). Finally, some environments are presented as a static resource (Shi et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2023) where agents are confined to accessing only those states that were previously cached during data collection, thus limiting the breadth and diversity of exploration. For evaluation, many environments focus on comparing the textual surfaceform of the predicted ‚àó Lead contributors. ‚Ä† Equal contribution. 1 arXiv:2307.13854v4  [cs.AI]  16 Apr 2024 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Tell me how much I spent on  food purchase in March 2023 15 WebArena Environment ‚Äù ‚Äù ‚Äú ‚Äú Create a ‚ÄòNolanFans\\' repo,  listing Nolan\\'s Oscar-winning  Ô¨Å lms in a README  Ô¨Å le Action Feedback AI Agent Tool Sites Knowledge resources Web applications from popular domains check_repo  check_readme  check_answer Functional  Success Functional  Failure Figure1: WebArena isastandalone,self-hostablewebenvironmentforbuildingautonomousagents. WebArena creates websites from four popular categories with functionality and data mimicking their real-world equivalents. To emulate human problem-solving, WebArena also embeds tools and knowledgeresourcesasindependentwebsites. WebArena introducesabenchmarkoninterpreting high-levelrealistic natural language command to concrete web-based interactions. We provide validators to programmatically validate the functional correctness of each task. action sequences with reference action sequences, disregarding the functionalcorrectness of the executionsandpossiblealternativesolutions(Puigetal.,2018;Jerniteetal.,2019;Xuetal.,2021;Li et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2023). These limitations often result in a discrepancy between simulated environments and the real world, and can potentially impact the generalizability of AI agents to successfully understand, adapt, and operate within complex real-world situations. We introduce WebArena , a realistic and reproducible web environment designed to facilitate the development of autonomous agents capable of executing tasks (¬ß2). An overview of WebArena is in Figure 1. Our environment comprises four fully operational, self-hosted web applications, eachrepresentingadistinctdomainprevalentontheinternet: onlineshopping,discussionforums, collaborativedevelopment,andbusinesscontentmanagement. Furthermore, WebArena incorporates several utility tools, such as map, calculator, and scratchpad, to best support possible human-like task executions. Lastly, WebArena iscomplementedbyanextensivecollectionofdocumentationand knowledgebasesthatvaryfromgeneralresourceslikeEnglishWikipediatomoredomain-specific references, such as manuals for using the integrated development tool (Fan et al., 2022). The content populating these websites is extracted from their real-world counterparts, preserving the authenticity of the content served on each platform. We deliver the hosting services using Docker containers with gym -APIs(Brockmanetal.,2016),ensuringboththeusabilityandthereproducibilityof WebArena . Along with WebArena , we release a ready-to-use benchmark with 812 long-horizon web-based tasks (¬ß3). Each task is described as a high-level natural language intent, emulating the abstract language usage patterns typically employed by humans (Bisk et al., 2019). Two example intents areshownintheupperleftofFigure1. Wefocusonevaluatingthe functionalcorrectness ofthese tasks, i.e., does the result of the execution actually achieve the desired goal (¬ß3.2). For instance, to evaluate the example in Figure 2, our evaluation method verifies the concrete contents in the designatedrepository. Thisevaluationisnotonlymorereliable(Zhongetal.,2017;Chenetal.,2021; Wang et al., 2022) than comparing the textual surface-form action sequences (Puig et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2023) but also accommodate a range of potential valid paths to achieve the same goal, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon in sufficiently complex tasks. We use this benchmark to evaluate several agents that can follow NL command and perform web- based tasks (¬ß4). These agents are implemented in a few-shot in-context learning fashion with powerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PALM-2 . Experiment results show that the best GPT-4 agent performance is somewhat limited, with an end-to-end task success rate of only 14.41%,whilethehumanperformanceis78.24%. Wehypothesizethatthelimitedperformanceof current LLMs stems from a lack of crucial capabilities such as active exploration and failure recovery tosuccessfullyperformcomplextasks (¬ß5.1).

Xu‚àóHao Zhu ‚Ä† Xuhui Zhou‚Ä† Robert Lo‚Ä† Abishek Sridhar‚Ä† Xianyi ChengTianyue Ou Yonatan Bisk Daniel Fried Uri Alon Graham NeubigCarnegie Mellon University{shuyanzh, fangzhex, gneubig}@cs.cmu.eduABSTRACTWith advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agentsto manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agentsare primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading toa disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environmentfor language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically,we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environmentwith fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, socialforum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management.Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledgebases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building uponour environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating thefunctional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse,long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on theinternet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniquessuch as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complextasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-endtask success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents,that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performancein these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.Our code, data, environment reproduction resources, and video demonstrations arepublicly available at https://webarena.dev/.1 INTRODUCTIONAutonomous agents that perform everyday tasks via human natural language commands couldsignificantly augment human capabilities, improve efficiency, and increase accessibility. Nonetheless,to fully leverage the power of autonomous agents, it is crucial to understand their behavior within anenvironment that is both authentic and reproducible. This will allow measurement of the ability ofagents on tasks that human users care about in a fair and consistent manner.Current environments for evaluate agents tend to over-simplify real-world situations. As a result, thefunctionality of many environments is a limited version of their real-world counterparts, leading toa lack of task diversity (Shi et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2018; Misra et al.,2016; Shridhar et al., 2020; 2021; Yao et al., 2022a). In addition, these simplifications often lowerthe complexity of tasks as compared to their execution in the real world (Puig et al., 2018; Shridharet al., 2020; Yao et al., 2022a). Finally, some environments are presented as a static resource (Shiet al., 2017; Deng et al., 2023) where agents are confined to accessing only those states that werepreviously cached during data collection, thus limiting the breadth and diversity of exploration.For evaluation, many environments focus on comparing the textual surface form of the predicted‚àóLead contributors.‚Ä†Equal contribution.1arXiv:2307.13854v4 [cs.AI] 16 Apr 2024\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024Tell me how much I spent onfood purchase in March 202315WebArena Environment‚Äù‚Äù‚Äú‚Äú Create a ‚ÄòNolanFans\\' repo,listing Nolan\\'s Oscar-winningfilms in a README fileActionFeedbackAI AgentTool Sites Knowledge resourcesWeb applications from popular domainscheck_repocheck_readmecheck_answerFunctionalSuccessFunctionalFailureFigure 1: WebArena is a standalone, self-hostable web environment for building autonomous agents.WebArena creates websites from four popular categories with functionality and data mimickingtheir real-world equivalents. To emulate human problem-solving, WebArena also embeds tools andknowledge resources as independent websites. WebArena introduces a benchmark on interpretinghigh-level realistic natural language command to concrete web-based interactions. We providevalidators to programmatically validate the functional correctness of each task.action sequences with reference action sequences, disregarding the functional correctness of theexecutions and possible alternative solutions (Puig et al., 2018; Jernite et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2021; Liet al., 2020; Deng et al., 2023). These limitations often result in a discrepancy between simulatedenvironments and the real world, and can potentially impact the generalizability of AI agents tosuccessfully understand, adapt, and operate within complex real-world situations.We introduce WebArena, a realistic and reproducible web environment designed to facilitate thedevelopment of autonomous agents capable of executing tasks (¬ß2). An overview of WebArenais in Figure 1. Our environment comprises four fully operational, self-hosted web applications,each representing a distinct domain prevalent on the internet: online shopping, discussion forums,collaborative development, and business content management. Furthermore, WebArena incorporatesseveral utility tools, such as map, calculator, and scratchpad, to best support possible human-like taskexecutions. Lastly, WebArena is complemented by an extensive collection of documentation andknowledge bases that vary from general resources like English Wikipedia to more domain-specificreferences, such as manuals for using the integrated development tool (Fan et al., 2022). The contentpopulating these websites is extracted from their real-world counterparts, preserving the authenticityof the content served on each platform. We deliver the hosting services using Docker containers withgym-APIs (Brockman et al., 2016), ensuring both the usability and the reproducibility of WebArena.Along with WebArena, we release a ready-to-use benchmark with 812 long-horizon web-basedtasks (¬ß3). Each task is described as a high-level natural language intent, emulating the abstractlanguage usage patterns typically employed by humans (Bisk et al., 2019). Two example intentsare shown in the upper left of Figure 1. We focus on evaluating the functional correctness of thesetasks, i.e., does the result of the execution actually achieve the desired goal (¬ß3.2). For instance,to evaluate the example in Figure 2, our evaluation method verifies the concrete contents in thedesignated repository. This evaluation is not only more reliable (Zhong et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2022) than comparing the textual surface-form action sequences (Puig et al., 2018; Denget al., 2023) but also accommodate a range of potential valid paths to achieve the same goal, which isa ubiquitous phenomenon in sufficiently complex tasks.We use this benchmark to evaluate several agents that can follow NL command and perform web-based tasks (¬ß4). These agents are implemented in a few-shot in-context learning fashion withpowerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PALM-2. Experiment results show thatthe best GPT-4 agent performance is somewhat limited, with an end-to-end task success rate of only14.41%, while the human performance is 78.24%. We hypothesize that the limited performance ofcurrent LLMs stems from a lack of crucial capabilities such as active exploration and failure recoveryto successfully perform complex tasks (¬ß5.1). These outcomes underscore the necessity for furtherdevelopment towards robust and effective agents (LeCun, 2022) in WebArena.2 WE BAR E N A : WEBSITES AS AN ENVIRONMENT FOR AUTONOMOUS AGENTSOur goal is to create a realistic and reproducible web environment.

Existing datasets for web agents either use simulated websites oronly cover a limited set of websites and tasks, thus not suitable for generalist webagents. With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected from 137 websites spanning31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the tasks, MIND2WEB pro-vides three necessary ingredients for building generalist web agents: 1) diversedomains, websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world websites instead of simulatedand simplified ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of user interaction patterns. Basedon MIND2WEB, we conduct an initial exploration of using large language models(LLMs) for building generalist web agents. While the raw HTML of real-world web-sites are often too large to be fed to LLMs, we show that first filtering it with a smallLM significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs. Our solutiondemonstrates a decent level of performance, even on websites or entire domains themodel has never seen before, but there is still a substantial room to improve towardstruly generalizable agents. We open-source our dataset, model implementation,and trained models (https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web) to facilitatefurther research on building a generalist agent for the web.1 IntroductionThe web now hosts billions of websites [7] that cover virtually every aspect of the digital world. Inthis work, we seek to answer the question: How can we build a generalist agent for the web that,given any website, can follow language instructions and carry out the corresponding tasks? Someexemplar tasks for such an agent are shown in Figure 1. A generalist agent could make the web moreaccessible, which is becoming increasingly difficult as modern websites provide increasingly morefunctionalities that also increase their complexity and learning curve. On the other hand, such an agentmay also turn the entire web into an unprecedentedly powerful and versatile tool [ 23, 27 ] that canenhance large language models (LLMs). For example, it may be used as a plugin for ChatGPT [ 24] todirectly acquire information and carry out actions on HTML websites, instead of only retrieving webcontent through a retriever tool [ 8 , 18 ] or relying on pre-defined APIs for each web service [ 34, 37 ].A generalist agent for the web shall meet the following desiderata: First, it shall work on any websiteon the Internet. Since it is infeasible to collect sufficient training data that covers all websites, thisrequires the agent to be inherently generalizable to websites or even domains it has never seen before.Second, it shall work on real-world websites, which can be dynamic, complex, and noisy. Mostmodern websites are dynamic, generating and rendering different content in response to user actions.This necessitates the agent to model each website as a partially-observable environment instead ofassuming full knowledge a priori. The agent should also not make strong simplifying assumptions‚àóCorresponding authors: {deng.595, sun.397, su.809}@osu.edu37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.arXiv:2306.06070v3 [cs.CL] 9 Dec 2023\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(a) Find one-way flights from New York toToronto.(b) Book a roundtrip on July 1 from Mumbai toLondon and vice versa on July 5 for two adults.(c) Find a flight from Chicago to London on20 April and return on 23 April.(d) Find Elon Musk\\'s profile and follow, startnotifications and like the latest tweet.(e) Browse comedy films streaming on Netflixthat was released from 1992 to 2007.(f) Open page to schedule an appointment forcar knowledge test.3.1%5.8%6.2%4.3%3.7% 2.4% 1.8%5.0%3.3%2.3%1.6% 1.6%3.8% 3.5% 3.5%3.2%2.0%3.7% 3.5% 6.5%3.4%2.1% 1.8% 1.7%1.9%2.0%2.7%3.5% 2.8%Travel (27.4%) Shopping (17.5%)Entertainment (16.1%)Info (20.4%) Service (18.3%)Other6.2%Ground3.7%Airlines5.8%Restaurant4.3%General3.1%CarRental2.4%Hotel1.8%Job3.5%Education2.8%Finance2.7%Cook-ing2.9%Housing3.7%SocialMedia3.5%Weather1.9%Government3.4%Pet2.1%Health6.5%Shipp-ing1.8%Moving1.7%HomeService2.5%Speciality5.0%Auto3.4%General3.3%Digital2.3%Depar-tment1.6%Fashion1.6%Event3.8%Music3.5%Sports3.5%Movie3.2%Game2.0%Figure 1: Sample tasks and all domains featured in MIND2WEB. The array of diversity allows fortesting an agent‚Äôs generalizability across tasks on the same website (a vs. b), similar tasks on differentwebsites (a vs. c), and even to entirely disparate tasks, websites, and domains (d‚àíf).about the environments but must embrace the full complexity and sometimes noise, e.g., due tosub-optimal website designs. Finally, it shall support diverse and sophisticated interactions withwebsites. Tasks from users can be highly diverse and take a large number of steps to complete (e.g.,the task in Figure 1(b) would take 14 actions). An agent that only supports simple tasks may providelimited value to users.Building an agent for the web is not entirely new. There have been numerous prior efforts invaried forms. However, none of them meets all the requirements for a generalist agent listed above.Existing work falls short in one to all of the following aspects: 1) Only operating in a limited andpre-specified set of websites [5 , 21 , 22 , 35 , 40], 2) making strong simplifying assumptions about thewebsites [22 , 40 ], and 3) only supporting specific types of tasks [ 21 , 22, 40 ] and/or requiring tediousstep-by-step instructions from users [ 5, 21, 22 , 39 ]. Meanwhile, LLMs have been shown to excel atgrounded language understanding in complex environments with good generalizability and sampleefficiency [ 2 , 13 , 17 , 33 ]. It is therefore promising to explore LLMs as a candidate solution towardsgeneralist agents for the web. However, there lacks a good dataset that can support the developmentand evaluation of generalist web agents, which is the focus of this work.In light of this, we present MIND2WEB, a new dataset with natural language tasks and manuallyannotated action sequences for developing and evaluating generalist agents for the web. It offers thefollowing unique features:1. Diverse coverage of domains, websites, and tasks. MIND2WEB boasts a collection of over 2,000tasks curated from 137 websites that span 31 different domains. This extensive range of tasks anddomains not only provides a vast landscape for exploration and learning but also opens up a new levelof versatility and complexity, fostering a more comprehensive evaluation of generalist web agents.2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Use of real-world websites. MIND2WEB replaces the oversimplified simulation environmentscommonly found in other datasets with an authentic, vibrant, and unpredictable realm of real-worldwebsites. We provide full traces of user interactions, webpage snapshots, and network traffic, makingit a rich source of raw, unfiltered, and dynamic data. By doing so, MIND2WEB equips models withthe capacity to interact and cope with the complexities and uncertainties of real-world environments,thereby encouraging the development of more robust and adaptive models.3. A broad spectrum of user interaction patterns. MIND2WEB enables users to engage insophisticated ways with websites, as opposed to basic operations such as searching, following links,and reading content commonly found in existing work. Users can click, select, and type in anyelements on the website, which significantly expands the space of possible tasks. This captures all thecommon actions users do on websites in real life and promotes the development of agents capable ofhandling complex tasks.With the diverse domains and websites, we create challenging out-of-distribution evaluation settingswhere agents are tested on their generalizability to websites or even entire domains never seen duringtraining. This presents a representative evaluation of generalist agents working on unseen websites.MIND2WEB enables us to conduct an initial exploration in using LLMs for building generalist webagents. The HTML document of real-world webpages may contain thousands of elements, whichmakes it infeasible or too costly to be fed into an LLM‚Äôs context. To address this issue, we proposeMINDACT, a two-stage model that involves first using a fine-tuned small LM to filter the web elementsand then using an LLM to select from the filtered elements in a multi-choice question answeringfa"

Animportant problem in the field of RE is long-tailed data, while not much attention is paid tothis problem using LLM approaches. There-fore, in this paper, we propose SLCoLM, amodel collaboration framework, to mitigate thedata long-tail problem. In our framework, weuse the ‚ÄúTraining-Guide-Predict‚Äù strategy tocombine the strengths of small pre-trained lan-guage models (SLMs) and LLMs, where a task-specific SLM framework acts as a guider, trans-fers task knowledge to the LLM and guides theLLM in performing RE tasks. Our experimentson an ancient Chinese RE dataset rich in rela-tion types show that the approach facilitates REof long-tail relation types.1 IntroductionRecently, large language models, such as GPT-3,have introduced In-context Learning (ICL) to en-hance performance with few-shot learning. How-ever, ICL is constrained by the length of themodel‚Äôs input, which limits the number of exam-ples that can be used. As a result, when sufficientsupervised data is available, ICL often cannot fullyleverage it. On the contrary, small pre-trained lan-guage models can quickly adapt to fit differenttasks, learn task-specific knowledge, and dominateboth training and reasoning when supervised datais sufficient. Given the advantages of SLMs andLLMs, there seem to be some complementary be-tween them. Some studies have started to discussthe issue of SLMs enhancing the performance ofLLMs Li et al.; Xu et al. (2023) .In joint relation extraction, various methods likemulti-task learning, span-based approaches (Ebertsand Ulges, 2021; Ji et al., 2020), and sequencelabeling-based methods (Wei et al., 2020) haveshown promise. These methods have outstand-ing results in enhancing task interaction and re-solving overlapping entities. However, they oftenstruggle with the long-tail problem due to the lim-ited availability of labeled data for many labels.To address this issue, some studies employ data-balancing techniques, while others use carefullydesigned loss functions (Lin et al., 2020). Re-cently, LLM advancement has provided new mo-mentum for relation extraction in various domains.Although LLMs still face challenges in understand-ing some low-resource domains, such as ancientChinese (Zhang and Li, 2023), they provide a novelexploration path.Motivated by the complementary strengths ofSLMs and LLMs, in this paper, we propose a frame-work for SLM-LLM collaboration called SLCoLM,with a ‚ÄúTrain-Guide-Predict‚Äù strategy, that com-bines the strengths of SLMs and LLMs to tackleRE tasks with long-tailed problem. Specifically,the SLM-based model is trained on the datasetto acquire task-relevant knowledge and generateinitial predictions for new samples. These SLM-generated predictions are then used to guide theLLMs during the generation process. The LLMsemploy a chain-of-thought (CoT) approach, pro-viding an explanation prior to making the final pre-diction. Finally, we combine the outputs from boththe SLMs and LLMs to obtain the final predictions.We use an ancient Chinese RE dataset as a casestudy to validate the effectiveness of the proposedframework. The experimental results demonstratethat the model collaboration framework effectivelyalleviates the long-tail problem.2 Related WorkSLMs fine-tuning with supervised data, such asBERT, RoBERTa, etc., perform well in many natu-ral language processing tasks. However, when deal-ing with complex tasks (e.g., fake news recogni-tion, machine translation, recommendation) or low-resource domain tasks, PLMs face knowledge andarXiv:2402.14373v2 [cs.CL] 20 Dec 2024\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ncapacity limitations [213]. Later, researchers foundthat scaling-up PLMs usually enhance downstreamtasks and that LLMs show some new capabilities,such as ICL, to solve complex tasks during thescaling-up process. However, LLMs are not usedin the same way as PLMs. They guide the modelthrough the process of processing complex tasksmainly through prompts. In addition, LLMs canmake use of external tools to improve their capabil-ities [211]. AutoML-GPT (Zhang et al., 2023) gen-erates prompts based on user requests and instructsthe GPT to connect to the AI model to achieve au-tomatic processing from data, model, and tuning,etc. Visual ChatGPT (Wu et al., 2023) embeds avisual base model into ChatGPT to achieve mul-timodal generation. These works demonstrate thestrong potential of LLMs to integrate external toolsdedicated to improving the performance of naturallanguage processing tasks by combining differentmodels.In practice, combining the strengths of both canmore comprehensively meet the needs of differenttasks and scenarios. For example, models can pro-vide knowledge to each other, Yang et al. (2023)proposed SuperContext to augment LLM cues byutilizing supervised knowledge provided by task-specific fine-tuning models for out-of-distribution(OOD) datasets. Xu et al. (2023) improved on ICLto obtain SuperICL, which efficiently performs theLLM by combining it with a small plug-in modelfor supervisory tasks. Luo et al. (2023b) proposedthe Parametric Knowledge Guiding (PKG) frame-work by fine-tuning the open-source LLMs to havethe ability to generate background knowledge, andthen using the background knowledge as a closed-source LLMs PKG is based on open-source LLMsand allows for offline memorization of any knowl-edge required by LLMs. A great advantage ofLLMs is the ability to generate background knowl-edge and explanations for the predicted results. Huet al. (2023) argued that current LLMs may not beable to replace PLMs fine-tuned in the detection offake news, but they can be a good advisor to PLMsby providing guided explanations from multipleperspectives.Model collaboration has also been applied insome specific tasks to mutually improve task perfor-mance. Hendy et al. (2023) explored a hybrid ap-proach that takes advantage of both GPT and Neu-ral Machine Translation (NMT) systems, proposingthe use of a Microsoft Translator (MS-Translator)as the primary system and switching to GPT as thebackup system when its quality is poor. Chenget al. (2023) proposed a synergistic framework thatconnects specialized translation models and gener-alized LLM into a single unified translation engine,which utilizes the translation results and confidenceof the PLM to join the LLM context learning ex-amples, mitigating the linguistic bias of the LLM,whilst the LLM helps mitigate the parallel databias of PLM. Recommend systems not only needto predict user preferences but also need to provideexplanations for the recommendations, Luo et al.(2023a) proposed the LLMXRec framework, whichenables the close collaboration between previousrecommendation models and LLMs-based expla-nation generators, generating explanations whileensuring the accuracy of the recommendation mod-els, making full use of the LLMs in generalizedinference and generative capabilities. In terms ofinformation extraction, Ma et al. (2023) propose‚Äúfilter-ranking‚Äù patterns to achieve model collabo-ration. The PLM is used to solve the informationextraction of simple samples, and the difficult sam-ples are selected according to the PLM, allowingthe large model to predict the difficult samples.3 MethodTo alleviate the long-tailed problem, we proposea model collaboration mechanism to fully com-bine the advantages of SLMs and LLMs and utilizethe annotated data. The ICL strategy of LLMsis constrained by the model‚Äôs input length, whichtypically limits the number of demonstrations thatcan be included. As a result, this approach maynot fully leverage the available supervised data,especially when such data is abundant. On the con-trary, SLMs can quickly adapt to different tasks,learn task-specific knowledge, and take advantageof both training and inference when superviseddata are sufficient. Given their respective strengths,there seems to be some complementarity betweenLLMs and SLMs.Therefore, we propose a ‚Äútrain-guide-predict‚Äùmodel collaboration mechanism, called SLCoLM,that leverages the SLMs to learn task knowledgefor head categories and the LLM‚Äôs extensive do-main knowledge to handle long-tail categories. Theillustration of model collaboration is shown in Fig-ure 1. Specifically, the SLMs are first trained withthe training dataset then they learn task-relatedknowledge and can make predictions for new sam-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrainingse"

Whenwe use a learned dense retriever on a retrievalcorpus at inference time, an often-overlookeddesign choice is the retrieval unit in which thecorpus is indexed, e.g. document, passage, orsentence. We discover that the retrieval unitchoice significantly impacts the performance ofboth retrieval and downstream tasks. Distinctfrom the typical approach of using passages orsentences, we introduce a novel retrieval unit,proposition, for dense retrieval. Propositionsare defined as atomic expressions within text,each encapsulating a distinct factoid and pre-sented in a concise, self-contained natural lan-guage format. We conduct an empirical com-parison of different retrieval granularity. Ourexperiments reveal that indexing a corpus byfine-grained units such as propositions signif-icantly outperforms passage-level units in re-trieval tasks. Moreover, constructing promptswith fine-grained retrieved units for retrieval-augmented language models improves the per-formance of downstream QA tasks given a spe-cific computation budget.1 IntroductionDense retrievers are a popular class of techniquesfor accessing external information sources for open-domain NLP tasks (Karpukhin et al., 2020). Beforewe use a learned dense retriever to retrieve from acorpus, an imperative design decision we have tomake is the retrieval unit ‚Äì i.e. the granularity atwhich we segment and index the retrieval corpusfor inference. In practice, the choice of retrievalunits, e.g. documents, fixed-length passage chunksor sentences, etc, is usually pre-determined based* Work was done during internship at Tencent AI Lab,Bellevue.¬ß https://github.com/chentong0/factoid-wikiQuestion: What is the angle of the Tower of Pisa?PassageRetrievalPrior to restoration work performed be-tween 1990 and 2001, the tower leaned atan angle of 5.5 degrees, but the tower nowleans at about 3.99 degrees.

We empiricallycompare the retrieval and downstream open-domain QA task performance when dense retrievers work withWikipedia indexed at the level of 100-word passages, sentences, or propositions (C, D).can replace passages in downstream QA tasks.Based on our empirical experiments, we discoverthat selecting the proper retrieval granularity at in-ference time can be a simple yet effective strategyfor improving dense retrievers‚Äô retrieval and down-stream QA performance. We illustrate our intuitionwith an example of open-domain QA in Table 1.The example shows retrieved text by the same re-triever at three different granularities. The pas-sage, which represents a coarser retrieval unit witha longer context, is theoretically able to providemore relevant information for the question. How-ever, a passage often includes extraneous details(e.g., restoration period and horizontal displace-ment in the example of Table 1) that could poten-tially distract both the retriever and the languagemodel in downstream tasks (Shi et al., 2023; Yuet al., 2023b). On the other hand, sentence-level in-dexing provides a finer-grained approach but doesnot entirely address the issue (Akkalyoncu Yilmazet al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). This is becausesentences can still be complex and compounded,and they are often not self-contained, lacking nec-essary contextual information (e.g., in the exampleof Table 1, ‚Äúthe tower‚Äù is the coreference of ‚ÄúPisaTower‚Äù) for judging the query-document relevance.To address these shortcomings of typical re-trieval units such as passages or sentences, we pro-pose using proposition as a novel retrieval unit fordense retrieval. Propositions are defined as atomicexpressions within text, where each encapsulatesa distinct factoid and is presented in a concise,self-contained natural language format. We showan example proposition in Table 1. The proposi-tion describes the information regarding the Towerof Pisa‚Äôs current leaning angle in a self-containedway and precisely responds to what the questionis querying. We provide a more detailed definitionand description of proposition in ¬ß2. To validatethe efficacy of using proposition as a retrieval unitfor dense retrievers inference, we first process andindex an English Wikipedia dump with all docu-ments segmented into propositions, which we referto as FACTOIDWIKI.We conduct experiments on five different open-domain QA datasets and empirically compare theperformance of four dual-encoder retrievers whenWikipedia is indexed by passages, sentences, andour proposed propositions. Notably, our findings in-dicate that proposition-based retrieval outperformssentence and passage-based retrieval, especially interms of generalization, as discussed in ¬ß5. Thissuggests that propositions, being both compact andrich in context, enable dense retrievers to accessprecise information while maintaining adequatecontext. The average improvement over passage-based retrieval of Recall@20 is +10.1 on unsuper-vised dense retrievers and +2.7 on supervised re-trievers, even though these retrievers were directlytrained on passage-level retrieval. Furthermore,we observe a distinct advantage of proposition-based retrieval in downstream QA performancewhen using retrieval-augmented language models,as elaborated in ¬ß6. Retrieval by finer-grained unitsinherently provides a higher density of question-relevant information. This finding implies usingfiner-grained units in the prompts achieves the sameperformance with a shorter input length, and hence,a faster inference time.Our main contributions are:2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n‚Ä¢ We provide a systemic study on how retrievalgranularity impacts retrieval and downstreamtask performance.

Both reveal significant performance gaps between current AI agents and human capabilities, highlighting important research challenges in the field.",

If your gold is:\n   - 22k (91.7% pure): ~$573\n   - 18k (75% pure): ~$469\n   - 14k (58.3% pure): ~$364\n\n2. **Market fluctuations**: Gold prices change daily based on economic conditions\n\n3. **Selling considerations**: Dealers typically pay 90-95% of spot price\n\nFor the most accurate current valuation, I'd recommend checking live gold prices on financial websites like Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, or precious metals dealers' websites, as gold prices can fluctuate significantly throughout the day.",

However, I can provide you with a general estimate based on typical gold prices.\n\n**Current Gold Price Estimate (as of late 2024):**\n- Gold typically trades around $2,000-2,100 per troy ounce\n- 1 troy ounce = 31.1035 grams\n\n**Calculation for your 9.5g of gold:**\n- 9.5g √∑ 31.1035g = 0.305 troy ounces\n- At $2,050/oz (approximate): 0.305 √ó $2,050 = **~$625**\n\n**Important considerations:**\n1. **Purity matters**: This assumes pure 24k gold. If your gold is:\n   - 22k (91.7% pure): ~$573\n   - 18k (75% pure): ~$469\n   - 14k (58.3% pure): ~$364\n\n2. **Market fluctuations**: Gold prices change daily based on economic conditions\n\n3. **Selling considerations**: Dealers typically pay 90-95% of spot price\n\nFor the most accurate current valuation, I'd recommend checking live gold prices on financial websites like Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, or precious metals dealers' websites, as gold prices can fluctuate significantly throughout the day.",

Here's what I accomplished:\n\n## Summary of Analysis and Report\n\nI read all three papers from the `/root/pdf/embodied_ai_papers` directory and created a comprehensive analysis report saved as `/root/markdown/embodied_ai_report.md`. The papers analyzed were:\n\n1. **PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model** (Danny Driess et al., 2023)\n2. **RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control** (Anthony Brohan et al., 2023)  \n3. **Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models** (Guanzhi Wang et al., 2023)\n\n## Key Findings from the Analysis\n\n### **Similarities:**\n- All three leverage large language models as core reasoning engines\n- Multimodal integration across vision, language, and action spaces\n- End-to-end learning from high-level instructions to low-level actions\n- Demonstrate emergent capabilities beyond explicit training\n- Show significant transfer learning benefits\n\n### **Key Differences:**\n- **Problem domains**: Real-world robotics (PaLM-E), lab robotics (RT-2), virtual environments (Voyager)\n- **Action representation**: Natural language (PaLM-E), tokenized actions (RT-2), executable code (Voyager)\n- **Learning approaches**: Joint training, co-fine-tuning, and in-context learning respectively\n- **Temporal scope**: Task-specific, immediate, and lifelong learning paradigms\n\n### **Technical Innovations:**\nEach paper contributed unique architectural and methodological advances, from PaLM-E's multimodal sentences to RT-2's vision-language-action models to Voyager's automatic curriculum and skill library.\n\nThe report provides a thorough comparison of methodologies, performance results, limitations, and future research directions, offering valuable insights into the current state and future potential of embodied AI research.\n\nThe complete analysis is now saved in the markdown file as requested!",

PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning ‚Äì from robot planning in environments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on multimodal sentences , i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in green and blue ) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange ) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end. Abstract Large language models have been demonstrated to perform complextasks. However,enablinggeneralinferenceinthe realworld,e.g.forroboticsproblems,raisesthechallenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to di- rectly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link be- tween words and percepts. Input to our embodied language modelaremulti-modalsentencesthatinterleavevisual,con- tinuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre- trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, canaddressavarietyofembodiedreasoningtasks,froma variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model beneÔ¨Åts fromdiversejointtrainingacrossinternet-scalelanguage, vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model, PaLM-E-562Bwith562Bparameters,inadditiontobeing trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reason- ing capabilities across various domains, including dialogue ( Glaese et al. , 2022 ; Thoppilan et al. , 2022 ), step-by-step reasoning( Weietal. , 2022 ; Kojimaetal. , 2022 ),mathprob- lemsolving( Lewkowyczetal. , 2022 ; Poluetal. , 2022 ),and code writing ( Chen et al. , 2021a ). However, a limitation of such models for inference in the real world is the issue of grounding: while training LLMs on massive textual data mayleadtorepresentationsthatrelatetoourphysicalworld, connecting those representations to real-world visual and physical sensor modalities is essential to solving a wider rangeof grounded real-worldproblemsincomputervision and robotics ( Tellex et al. , 2020 ). Previous work ( Ahn et al. , 2022 ) interfaces the output of LLMs with learned robotic policiesandaffordancefunctionstomakedecisions,butis limitedinthattheLLMitselfisonlyprovidedwithtextual input, which is insufÔ¨Åcient for many tasks where the geo- metric conÔ¨Åguration of the scene is important. Further, in ourexperimentsweshowthatcurrentstate-of-the-art visual - language models trained on typical vision-language tasks such as visual-question-answering (VQA) cannot directly solve robotic reasoning tasks. In this paperwe propose embodied languagemodels, which arXiv:2303.03378v1  [cs.LG]  6 Mar 2023 PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model Figure2: PaLM-E-562Bcando zero-shotmultimodalchain-of-thoughtreasoning ,cantellvisually-conditionedjokesgivenanimage,and demonstrates an array of robot-relevant multimodal-informed capabilities including perception, visually-grounded dialogue, and planning. PaLM-E also generalizes, zero-shot, to multi-image prompts despite only being trained on single-image prompts. PaLM-E can also performmathgivenanimagewithtextually-interleavedhandwrittennumbers. Inaddition, themodelcanperform, zero-shot, questionand answering on temporally-annotated egocentric vision, similar to what was shown in ( Zeng et al. , 2022 ) but end-to-end all in one model. directlyincorporatecontinuousinputsfromsensormodali- tiesofanembodiedagentandtherebyenablethelanguage model itself to make more grounded inferences for sequen- tialdecisionmakingintherealworld. Inputssuchasimages andstateestimatesareembeddedintothesamelatentembed- ding as language tokens and processed by the self-attention layers of a Transformer-based LLM in the same way as text. We start from a pre-trained LLM in which we inject the continuousinputsthroughanencoder. Theseencodersare trainedend-to-endtooutputsequentialdecisionsintermsof natural text that can be interpreted by the embodied agent byconditioninglow-levelpoliciesorgiveananswertoan embodied question. We evaluate the approach in a vari- ety of settings, comparing different input representations (e.g. standard vs. object-centric ViT encodings for visual input), freezing vs. Ô¨Ånetuning the language model while training the encoders, and investigating whether co-training on multiple tasks enables transfer. To investigate the approach‚Äôs breadth, we evaluate on three robotic manipulation domains (two of which are closed- loop in the real-world), standard visual-language tasks such as VQA and image captioning, as well as language tasks. Ourresultsindicatethatmulti-tasktrainingimprovesperfor- mancecomparedtotrainingmodelsonindividualtasks. We show that this transfer across tasks can lead to high data- efÔ¨Åciency for robotics tasks, e.g. signiÔ¨Åcantly increasing learning success from handfuls of training examples, and even demonstrating one-shot or zero-shot generalization to novel combinations of objects or unseen objects. We scale PaLM-E up to 562B parameters, integrating the 540B PaLM ( Chowdhery et al. , 2022 ) LLM and the 22B Vision Transformer (ViT) ( Dehghani et al. , 2023 ) into, to our knowledge, the largest vision-language model currently reported. PaLM-E-562B achieves state-of-the-art perfor- mance on the OK-VQA ( Marino et al. , 2019 ) benchmark, without relying on task-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Ånetuning. Although not thefocusofourexperimentation,wealsoÔ¨Ånd(Fig. 2 )that PaLM-E-562Bexhibitsawide arrayofcapabilitiesinclud- ingzero-shotmultimodalchain-of-thought(CoT)reasoning, few-shotprompting,OCR-freemathreasoning,andmulti- imagereasoning,despitebeingtrainedononlysingle-image examples. Zero-shot CoT ( Kojima et al. , 2022 ), originally a language-only concept, has been shown on multimodal data with task-speciÔ¨Åc programs ( Zeng et al. , 2022 ) but to our knowledge, not via an end-to-end model. To summarize our main contributions, we (1) propose and demonstrate that a generalist, transfer-learned, multi- embodiment decision-making agent can be trained via mix- ing in embodied data into the training of a multimodal large PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model language model. We show that, (2) while current state-of- the-art general-purpose visual-language models out-of-the- box (zero-shot) do not well address embodied reasoning problems,itispossibletotrainacompetentgeneral-purpose visual-language model that is also an efÔ¨Åcient embodied reasoner. In studying how to best train such models, we (3) introduce novel architectural ideas such as neural scene rep- resentations and entity-labeling multimodal tokens.

Building on suc- cessesinlargelanguage( Brownetal. , 2020 ; Devlinetal. , 2018 )andvision( Dosovitskiyetal. , 2020 )models,recent years have seen a growing interest in large vision-language models(VLMs)( Lietal. , 2019 ; Luetal. , 2019 ; Haoetal. , 2022 ; Ganetal. , 2022 ). Unliketheirpredecessors,VLMs are capable of simultaneously understanding both images and text, and can be applied to tasks such as visual ques- tion answering ( Zhou et al. , 2020 ; Zellers et al. , 2021b ), captioning ( Hu et al. , 2022 ), optical character recognition ( Lietal. , 2021 ),andobjectdetection( Chenetal. , 2021b ). The methods by which images are integrated varies. For ex- ample, Alayrac etal. ( 2022 ) augments pretrainedlanguage models with a mechanism to directly attend to a single con- text image. In contrast, PaLM-E represents images and textas‚Äúmultimodalsentences‚Äùoflatentvectors,allowing it to process multiple images in a Ô¨Çexible way within any part of a sentence. More closely related to our work is Frozen ( Tsimpoukelli et al. , 2021 ) where vision encoder parameters are optimized via backpropagation through a frozen LLM ( Lu et al. , 2021 ). Inspired by this work, we investigate the design in a broader scope by introducing alternative input modalities (e.g. neural scene representa- tions), and our proposed approach empirically outperforms Frozen by more than 45% on the VQAv2 benchmark. More importantlywedemonstratethatPaLM-Eisapplicablenot only to perceptual but also embodied tasks. Actions-output models.

Authors listed in alphabetical order, with contributions listed in Appendix A . We study how vision-language models trained on Internet-scale data can be incorporated directly into end-to-end robotic control to boost generalization and enable emergent semantic reasoning. Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language data from the web. To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to other approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language responses and robotic actions into the same format, we express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them directly into the training set of the model in the same way as natural language tokens. We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities from Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved generalization to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present in the robot training data (such as placing an object onto a particular number or icon), and the ability to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest to another object). We further show that incorporating chain of thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, for example figuring out which object to pick up for use as an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best suited for someone who is tired (an energy drink). 1. Introduction High-capacity models pretrained on broad web-scale datasets provide an effective and powerful platform for a wide range of downstream tasks: large language models can enable not only fluent text generation( Aniletal. , 2023 ; Brohanetal. , 2022 ; OpenAI , 2023 )butemergentproblem-solving( Cobbe et al. , 2021 ; Lewkowycz et al. , 2022 ; Polu et al. , 2022 ) and creative generation of prose ( Brown et al. , 2020 ; OpenAI , 2023 ) and code ( Chen et al. , 2021 ), while vision-language models enable open-vocabulary visual recognition ( Kirillov et al. , 2023 ; Minderer et al. , 2022 ; Radford et al. , 2021 ) andcanevenmakecomplexinferencesaboutobject-agentinteractionsinimages( Alayracetal. , 2022 ; Chenetal. , 2023a , b ; Driessetal. , 2023 ; Haoetal. , 2022 ; Huangetal. , 2023 ; Wangetal. , 2022 ). Such semantic reasoning, problem solving, and visual interpretation capabilities would be tremendously useful for generalist robots that must perform a variety of tasks in real-world environments.

Duringinference,thetexttokensarede-tokenized into robot actions, enabling closed loop control. This allows us to leverage the backbone and pretraining of vision-language models in learning robotic policies, transferring some of their generalization, semantic understanding, and reasoning to robotic control. We demonstrate examples of RT-2 execution on the project website: robotics-transformer2.github.io . it is unclear how robots should acquire such capabilities. While a brute force approach might entail collecting millions of robotic interaction trials, the most capable language and vision-language models are trained on billions of tokens and images from the web ( Alayrac et al. , 2022 ; Chen et al. , 2023a , b ; Huang et al. , 2023 ) ‚Äì an amount unlikely to be matched with robot data in the near future. On the other hand, directly applying such models to robotic tasks is also difficult: such models reason about semantics, labels, and textual prompts, whereas robots require grounded low-level actions, such as Cartesian end-effector commands. While a number of recent works have sought to incorporate language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) into robotics ( Ahn et al. , 2022 ; Driess et al. , 2023 ; Vemprala et al. , 2023 ), such methods generally address only the ‚Äúhigher level‚Äù aspects of robotic planning, essentially taking the role of a state machine that interprets commands and parses them into individual primitives (such as picking and placing objects), which are then executed by separate low-level controllers that themselves do not benefit from the rich semantic knowledge of Internet-scale models during training. Therefore, in this paper we ask: can large pretrained vision- language models be integrated directly into low-level robotic control to boost generalization and enable emergent semantic reasoning? To this end, we explore an approach that is both simple and surprisingly effective: we directly train vision-language models designed for open-vocabulary visual question answering and visual dialogue to output low-level robot actions, along with solving other Internet-scale vision-language tasks. Although such models are typically trained to produce natural language tokens, we can train them on robotic trajectories by tokenizing the actions into text tokens and creating ‚Äúmultimodal sentences‚Äù ( Driess et al. , 2023 ) that ‚Äúrespond‚Äù to robotic instructions paired with camera observations by producing corresponding actions. In this way, vision-language models can be directly trained to act as instruction following robotic policies. This simple approach is in contrast with prior alternatives for incorporating VLMs into robot policies ( Shridhar et al. , 2022a ) or designing new vision-language- action architectures from scratch ( Reed et al. , 2022 ): instead, pre-existing vision-language models, with already-amortized significant compute investment, are trained without any new parameters to output text-encoded actions. We refer to this category of models as vision-language-action (VLA) models. We instantiate VLA models by building on the protocol proposed for RT-1 ( Brohan et al. , 2022 ), using a similar dataset, but expanding the model to use a large vision-language backbone. Hence we refer to our model as RT-2 (Robotics Transformer 2). We provide an overview in Figure 1 . 2 RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control We observe that robotic policies derived from such vision-language models exhibit a range of remarkable capabilities, combining the physical motions learned from the robot data with the ability to interpret images and text learned from web data into a single model. Besides the expected benefit of dramatically improving generalization to novel objects and semantically varied instructions, we observe a number of emergent capabilities. While the model‚Äôs physical skills are still limited to the distribution of skills seen in the robot data, the model acquires the ability to deploy those skills in new ways by interpreting images and language commands using knowledge gleaned from the web. Some example highlights are shown in Figure 2 . The model is able to re-purpose pick and place skills learned from robot data to place objects near semantically indicated locations, such as specific numbers or icons, despite those cues not being present in the robot data. The model can also interpret relations between objects to determine which object to pick and where to place it, despite no such relations being provided in the robot demonstrations. Furthermore, if we augment the command with chain of thought prompting, the model is able to make even m"

Classical approaches employreinforcementlearning(RL)[ 6 , 7 ]andimitationlearning[ 8 ‚Äì 10 ]thatoperateonprimitive actions, which could be challenging for systematic exploration [ 11 ‚Äì 15 ], interpretability [ 16 ‚Äì 18 ], and generalization[ 19 ‚Äì 21 ]. Recentadvancesinlargelanguagemodel(LLM)basedagentsharnessthe world knowledge encapsulated in pre-trained LLMs to generate consistent action plans or executable policies [ 16 , 22 , 19 ]. They are applied to embodied tasks like games and robotics [ 23 ‚Äì 27 ], as well as NLP tasks without embodiment [ 28 ‚Äì 30 ]. However, these agents are not lifelong learners that can progressively acquire, update, accumulate, and transfer knowledge over extended time spans [ 31 , 32 ]. Let us consider Minecraft as an example. Unlike most other games studied in AI [ 33 , 34 , 10 ], Minecraft does not impose a predefined end goal or a fixed storyline but rather provides a unique playgroundwithendlesspossibilities[ 23 ]. Minecraftrequiresplayerstoexplorevast,procedurally generated 3D terrains and unlock a tech tree using gathered resources. Human players typically start bylearningthebasics,suchasminingwoodandcookingfood,beforeadvancingtomorecomplex taskslikecombatingmonstersandcraftingdiamondtools. Wearguethataneffectivelifelonglearning agent should have similar capabilities as human players: (1) propose suitable tasks based on its current skill level and world state, e.g., learn to harvest sand and cactus before iron if it finds itself in adesertratherthanaforest;(2) refineskills basedonenvironmentalfeedbackand commitmastered skillstomemory forfuturereuseinsimilarsituations (e.g. fighting zombiesissimilartofighting spiders); (3) continually explore the world and seek out new tasks in a self-driven manner. Towards these goals, we introduce V OYAGER , the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent to drive exploration, master a wide range of skills, and make new discoveries continually without human intervention in Minecraft. V OYAGER is made possible through three key modules (Fig. 2): 1) an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration; 2) a skill library for storing and retrieving complex behaviors; and 3) a new iterative prompting mechanism that generates executablecodeforembodiedcontrol. Weopttousecodeastheactionspaceinsteadoflow-level motor commands because programs can naturally represent temporally extended and compositional actions[ 16 , 22 ],whichareessentialformanylong-horizontasksinMinecraft. V OYAGER interacts withablackboxLLM(GPT-4[ 35 ])throughpromptingandin-contextlearning[ 36 ‚Äì 38 ]. Ourapproach bypasses the need for model parameter access and explicit gradient-based training or finetuning. More specifically, V OYAGER attempts to solve progressively harder tasks proposed by the automatic curriculum , which takes into account the exploration progress and the agent‚Äôs state. The curriculum is generated by GPT-4 based on the overarching goal of ‚Äúdiscovering as many diverse things as possible‚Äù. Thisapproachcanbeperceivedasanin-contextformof noveltysearch [ 39 , 40 ]. V OYAGER incrementally builds a skill library by storing the action programs that help solve a task successfully. 2 Figure3: Tasksproposedbytheautomaticcurriculum. Weonlydisplaythepartialpromptforbrevity. See Appendix, Sec. A.3 for the full prompt structure. Each program is indexed by the embedding of its description, which can be retrieved in similar situationsinthefuture. Complexskillscanbesynthesizedby composing simplerprograms,which compounds V OYAGER ‚Äôs capabilities rapidly over time and alleviates catastrophic forgetting in other continual learning methods [31, 32]. However, LLMs struggle to produce the correct action code consistently in one shot [ 41 ]. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative prompting mechanism that: (1) executes the generated programtoobtainobservationsfromtheMinecraftsimulation(suchasinventorylistingandnearby creatures)anderrortracefromthecodeinterpreter(ifany);(2)incorporatesthefeedbackintoGPT-4‚Äôs prompt for another round of code refinement; and (3) repeats the process until a self-verification module confirms the task completion, at which point we commit the program to the skill library (e.g., craftStoneShovel() and combatZombieWithSword() )andquerytheautomaticcurriculumfor the next milestone (Fig. 2). Empirically, V OYAGER demonstratesstrong in-contextlifelonglearning capabilities. Itcanconstruct anever-growingskilllibraryofactionprogramsthatarereusable,interpretable,andgeneralizable to novel tasks. We evaluate V OYAGER systematically against other LLM-based agent techniques (e.g., ReAct [ 29 ], Reflexion [ 30 ], AutoGPT [ 28 ]) in MineDojo [ 23 ], an open-source Minecraft AI framework. V OYAGER outperformspriorSOTAbyobtaining 3 . 3 √ó moreuniqueitems,unlockingkey techtreemilestonesupto 15 . 3 √ó faster,andtraversing 2 . 3 √ó longerdistances. Wefurtherdemonstrate that V OYAGER isabletoutilizethelearnedskilllibraryinanewMinecraftworldtosolvenoveltasks from scratch, while other methods struggle to generalize. 2 Method V OYAGER consists of three novel components: (1) an automatic curriculum (Sec. 2.1) that suggests objectives for open-ended exploration, (2) a skill library (Sec. 2.2) for developing increasingly complexbehaviors,and(3)aniterativepromptingmechanism(Sec.2.3)thatgeneratesexecutable code for embodied control. Full prompts are presented in Appendix, Sec. A. 2.1 Automatic Curriculum Embodiedagentsencounteravarietyofobjectiveswithdifferentcomplexitylevelsinopen-ended environments. An automatic curriculum offers numerous benefits for open-ended exploration, ensur- ing a challenging but manageable learning process, fostering curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation foragentstolearnandexplore,andencouragingthedevelopmentofgeneralandflexibleproblem- solving strategies [ 42 ‚Äì 44 ]. Our automatic curriculum capitalizes on the internet-scale knowledge contained withinGPT-4by prompting it toprovide a steady stream of new tasksor challenges. The curriculum unfolds in a bottom-up fashion, allowing for considerable adaptability and responsiveness to the exploration progress and the agent‚Äôs current state (Fig. 3). As V OYAGER progresses to harder self-driven goals, it naturally learns a variety of skills, such as ‚Äúmining a diamond‚Äù. 3 Figure 4: Skill library. Top: Adding a new skill.

The available tools are focused on League of Legends and TFT. However, I can provide you with general guidance about Jiyan team building based on common knowledge about Wuthering Waves:\n\n## Jiyan Team Building Recommendations\n\n**Jiyan** is an Aero (Wind) element DPS character in Wuthering Waves who excels at dealing sustained damage with his spear attacks and aerial combos.\n\n### Recommended Team Composition:\n\n**Sub-DPS/Buffer Options:**\n- **Mortefi** - Excellent sub-DPS that provides Fusion damage and can trigger elemental reactions with Jiyan's Aero attacks\n- **Sanhua** - Glacio sub-DPS who can provide good off-field damage and crowd control\n- **Yangyang** - Another Aero character who can provide energy generation and resonance bonuses\n\n**Healer/Support Options:**\n- **Verina** - Top-tier healer who provides excellent healing and team buffs, making her ideal for keeping Jiyan healthy during extended fights\n- **Baizhi** - Solid healer option with good utility and healing capabilities\n\n### Best Echo Set for Jiyan:\n\n**Recommended Main Echo:** **Feilian Beringal**\n- This is generally considered his best main echo as it provides excellent damage scaling and complements his aerial combat style\n\n**Echo Set:** **Sierra Gale (5-piece set)**\n- Provides Aero damage bonus\n- Increases damage after using Liberation (Ultimate)\n- Perfect synergy with Jiyan's kit and element\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Jiyan is an Aero DPS who relies heavily on his Liberation ability\n- The Sierra Gale set amplifies his Aero damage and rewards using his ultimate frequently\n- Feilian Beringal provides strong damage scaling that matches his playstyle\n\nFor more specific and up-to-date information about optimal builds, substats, and team rotations, I'd recommend checking dedicated Wuthering Waves community resources like official guides, Reddit communities, or gaming websites that specialize in the game.",

The Publish button will only be enabled when both fields contain non-empty, non-whitespace content, exactly as you specified!",

The Publish button will only be enabled when both fields contain non-empty, non-whitespace content, exactly as you specified!",

Here's my detailed analysis:\n\n## **Best Paper Identified: WebGuard**\n\nThis paper stands out as the most significant contribution for several reasons:\n- **Comprehensive scope**: Addresses a critical and urgent problem in web agent deployment\n- **Practical impact**: Provides the first comprehensive dataset and guardrail system for web agent safety\n- **Methodological rigor**: Includes extensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings\n- **Open-source contribution**: Makes all resources publicly available for the research community\n\n## **Main Motivation**\n\nThe primary motivation behind WebGuard stems from a critical gap in web agent safety. As LLM-powered autonomous web agents become increasingly capable and widely deployed, they pose significant risks of taking unintended or harmful actions in real-world online environments. The authors identified that:\n\n1. **Safety Gap**: Current web agents lack effective safety measures comparable to access controls for human users\n2. **Deployment Risk**: Even frontier LLMs show concerning deficiencies in predicting action outcomes and identifying high-risk actions\n3. **Research Gap**: No comprehensive framework existed for assessing web agent action risks or developing guardrails\n\nThe motivation is essentially to bridge the safety gap before widespread deployment of web agents leads to harmful consequences.\n\n## **Methodology**\n\nWebGuard employs a multi-faceted methodology:\n\n### **Dataset Creation**\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193 websites across 22 diverse domains\n- **Risk Categorization**: Novel three-tier risk schema (SAFE, LOW, HIGH)\n- **Real-world Focus**: Includes often-overlooked long-tail websites for better generalization\n- **Structured Splits**: Designated training and test splits for diverse generalization evaluation\n\n### **Guardrail Development**\n- **Specialized Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model as a dedicated guardrail\n- **Multi-modal Approach**: Incorporates both visual and textual information from web pages\n- **Outcome Prediction**: Focuses on predicting the consequences of state-changing actions\n\n### **Evaluation Framework**\n- **Multiple Generalization Settings**: Tests across different websites, domains, and action types\n- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy for overall prediction and recall for high-risk action detection\n- **Baseline Comparisons**: Evaluates frontier LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) as baselines\n\n## **Key Results**\n\nThe paper presents several important findings:\n\n### **Baseline Performance Gaps**\n- **Frontier LLM Limitations**: Even advanced LLMs achieve less than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes\n- **High-Risk Detection**: Less than 60% recall in flagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting deployment dangers\n- **Generalization Challenges**: Performance varies significantly across different website types and domains\n\n### **Guardrail Improvements**\n- **Substantial Performance Gains**: Fine-tuned guardrail model boosted accuracy from 37% to 80%\n- **High-Risk Recall**: Improved HIGH-risk action recall from 20% to 76%\n- **Consistent Outperformance**: Specialized guardrail consistently outperformed general-purpose LLMs\n\n### **Deployment Reality Check**\n- **Reliability Gap**: Despite improvements, performance still falls short of near-perfect accuracy required for high-stakes deployment\n- **Safety Threshold**: The results indicate current technology isn't ready for unsupervised deployment in critical applications\n- **Research Direction**: Establishes clear benchmarks and identifies areas needing further research\n\n### **Open-Source Impact**\n- **Community Resource**: All datasets, annotation tools, and fine-tuned models made publicly available\n- **Research Acceleration**: Provides standardized evaluation framework for future web agent safety research\n\n## **Significance and Impact**\n\nWebGuard represents a paradigm shift from focusing solely on web agent capabilities to addressing their safety and reliability. It provides the first systematic approach to web agent risk assessment and establishes a foundation for safe deployment of autonomous web agents in real-world applications.\n\nThe paper's emphasis on the gap between current performance and deployment requirements serves as a crucial wake-up call for the field, advocating for responsible development practices before widespread adoption.",

This situation underscores an urgent need for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193 websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema: SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from 20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.\\\\n\\\\nAccess Options:\\\\n- Abstract page: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14293v1\\\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.14293v1\\\\n- PDF version: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14293v1\\\\n\\\\nAdditional Information:\\\\n- Comment: We publicly release WebGuard, along with its annotation tools and fine-tuned models, to facilitate open-source research on monitoring and safeguarding web agents.

Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents\\' performance and closing the capability gap.\\\\n\\\\nAccess Options:\\\\n- Abstract page: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02592v1\\\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.02592v1\\\\n- PDF version: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02592v1\\\\n\",\\n      \"annotations\": null\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"isError\": false\\n}', annotations=None)] isError=False"

Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.\\\\n\\\\nAccess Options:\\\\n- Abstract page: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04103v1\\\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.04103v1\\\\n- PDF version: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04103v1\\\\n\",\\n      \"annotations\": null\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"isError\": false\\n}', annotations=None)] isError=False"

While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities. Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research: rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface (AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving the broader ML community.\\\\n\\\\nAccess Options:\\\\n- Abstract page: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10953v1\\\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2506.10953v1\\\\n- PDF version: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10953v1\\\\n\",\\n      \"annotations\": null\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"isError\": false\\n}', annotations=None)] isError=False"

                "content": "Based on my analysis of the latest research papers on web agents, I can identify **\"WebGuard: Building a Generalizable Guardrail for Web Agents\"** (arXiv:2507.14293, published July 18, 2025) as the most comprehensive and impactful paper among the recent publications. Here's my detailed analysis:\n\n## **Best Paper Identified: WebGuard**\n\nThis paper stands out as the most significant contribution for several reasons:\n- **Comprehensive scope**: Addresses a critical and urgent problem in web agent deployment\n- **Practical impact**: Provides the first comprehensive dataset and guardrail system for web agent safety\n- **Methodological rigor**: Includes extensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings\n- **Open-source contribution**: Makes all resources publicly available for the research community\n\n## **Main Motivation**\n\nThe primary motivation behind WebGuard stems from a critical gap in web agent safety. As LLM-powered autonomous web agents become increasingly capable and widely deployed, they pose significant risks of taking unintended or harmful actions in real-world online environments. The authors identified that:\n\n1. **Safety Gap**: Current web agents lack effective safety measures comparable to access controls for human users\n2. **Deployment Risk**: Even frontier LLMs show concerning deficiencies in predicting action outcomes and identifying high-risk actions\n3. **Research Gap**: No comprehensive framework existed for assessing web agent action risks or developing guardrails\n\nThe motivation is essentially to bridge the safety gap before widespread deployment of web agents leads to harmful consequences.\n\n## **Methodology**\n\nWebGuard employs a multi-faceted methodology:\n\n### **Dataset Creation**\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193 websites across 22 diverse domains\n- **Risk Categorization**: Novel three-tier risk schema (SAFE, LOW, HIGH)\n- **Real-world Focus**: Includes often-overlooked long-tail websites for better generalization\n- **Structured Splits**: Designated training and test splits for diverse generalization evaluation\n\n### **Guardrail Development**\n- **Specialized Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model as a dedicated guardrail\n- **Multi-modal Approach**: Incorporates both visual and textual information from web pages\n- **Outcome Prediction**: Focuses on predicting the consequences of state-changing actions\n\n### **Evaluation Framework**\n- **Multiple Generalization Settings**: Tests across different websites, domains, and action types\n- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy for overall prediction and recall for high-risk action detection\n- **Baseline Comparisons**: Evaluates frontier LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) as baselines\n\n## **Key Results**\n\nThe paper presents several important findings:\n\n### **Baseline Performance Gaps**\n- **Frontier LLM Limitations**: Even advanced LLMs achieve less than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes\n- **High-Risk Detection**: Less than 60% recall in flagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting deployment dangers\n- **Generalization Challenges**: Performance varies significantly across different website types and domains\n\n### **Guardrail Improvements**\n- **Substantial Performance Gains**: Fine-tuned guardrail model boosted accuracy from 37% to 80%\n- **High-Risk Recall**: Improved HIGH-risk action recall from 20% to 76%\n- **Consistent Outperformance**: Specialized guardrail consistently outperformed general-purpose LLMs\n\n### **Deployment Reality Check**\n- **Reliability Gap**: Despite improvements, performance still falls short of near-perfect accuracy required for high-stakes deployment\n- **Safety Threshold**: The results indicate current technology isn't ready for unsupervised deployment in critical applications\n- **Research Direction**: Establishes clear benchmarks and identifies areas needing further research\n\n### **Open-Source Impact**\n- **Community Resource**: All datasets, annotation tools, and fine-tuned models made publicly available\n- **Research Acceleration**: Provides standardized evaluation framework for future web agent safety research\n\n## **Significance and Impact**\n\nWebGuard represents a paradigm shift from focusing solely on web agent capabilities to addressing their safety and reliability. It provides the first systematic approach to web agent risk assessment and establishes a foundation for safe deployment of autonomous web agents in real-world applications.\n\nThe paper's emphasis on the gap between current performance and deployment requirements serves as a crucial wake-up call for the field, advocating for responsible development practices before widespread adoption.",

Here's your comprehensive bike route plan:\n\n## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bike Route: UCAS Zhongguancun Campus ‚Üí UCAS Yanqihu Campus\n\n### **Route Summary**\n- **Total Distance:** 65.4 km (40.6 miles)\n- **Estimated Travel Time:** 52 minutes and 26 seconds (3,145.7 seconds)\n- **Transportation Mode:** Bicycle\n\n### **Key Route Highlights**\nThe route takes you through several major roads and highways in Beijing:\n\n**Urban Section (Starting from Zhongguancun):**\n1. **ÈÇ±Âæ∑ÊãîË∑Ø (Qiudeba Road)** - 38m\n2. **‰∏úÂçóÈó®ÂÜÖÂ§ßË°ó (Dongnanmen Inner Street)** - 137m  \n3. **‰∏≠ÂÖ≥ÊùëÂåóÂ§ßË°ó (Zhongguancun North Street)** - 720m total\n4. **ÂåóÂõõÁéØË•øË∑Ø/‰∏≠Ë∑Ø/‰∏úË∑Ø (North 4th Ring Road West/Middle/East)** - 9.8km\n\n**Highway Section:**\n5. **‰∫¨ÊâøÈ´òÈÄü (Jingcheng Expressway)** - 21.4km\n6. **Â§ßÂ∫Ü-ÂπøÂ∑ûÈ´òÈÄüÂÖ¨Ë∑Ø (Daqing-Guangzhou Expressway)** - 17.9km\n7. **‰∫¨ÂØÜÈ´òÈÄü (Jingmi Expressway)** - 3.8km\n\n**Final Approach to Yanqihu Campus:**\n8. **ÊÄÄÈõÅË∑Ø (Huaiyan Road)** - 3.5km\n9. **‰∫¨Êº†Á∫ø (Jingmo Line)** - 4.1km\n\n### **Important Notes for Cyclists**\n‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Considerations:**\n- This route includes major highways and expressways which may **not be suitable or legal for bicycles**\n- The calculated route appears to follow car/motor vehicle paths\n- **Recommended:** Use dedicated bike lanes and local roads instead of highways\n\n### **Alternative Recommendations**\nFor a safer cycling experience, consider:\n1. **Using local roads and bike paths** parallel to the highways\n2. **Taking public transportation** for part of the journey (subway + bike)\n3. **Planning rest stops** as this is quite a long distance for cycling\n4. **Checking weather conditions** before departure\n5. **Bringing water, snacks, and repair tools** for the journey\n\n### **Estimated Realistic Cycling Time**\nWhile the routing algorithm suggests ~52 minutes, a more realistic estimate for recreational cycling on safe roads would be **2-3 hours**, considering:\n- Traffic lights and intersections\n- Rest breaks\n- Using safer, possibly longer routes\n- Average cycling speeds on urban roads\n\nWould you like me to help you find alternative transportation options or more detailed information about bike-friendly routes in Beijing?",

Here's your comprehensive bike route plan:\n\n## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bike Route: UCAS Zhongguancun Campus ‚Üí UCAS Yanqihu Campus\n\n### **Route Summary**\n- **Total Distance:** 65.4 km (40.6 miles)\n- **Estimated Travel Time:** 52 minutes and 26 seconds (3,145.7 seconds)\n- **Transportation Mode:** Bicycle\n\n### **Key Route Highlights**\nThe route takes you through several major roads and highways in Beijing:\n\n**Urban Section (Starting from Zhongguancun):**\n1. **ÈÇ±Âæ∑ÊãîË∑Ø (Qiudeba Road)** - 38m\n2. **‰∏úÂçóÈó®ÂÜÖÂ§ßË°ó (Dongnanmen Inner Street)** - 137m  \n3. **‰∏≠ÂÖ≥ÊùëÂåóÂ§ßË°ó (Zhongguancun North Street)** - 720m total\n4. **ÂåóÂõõÁéØË•øË∑Ø/‰∏≠Ë∑Ø/‰∏úË∑Ø (North 4th Ring Road West/Middle/East)** - 9.8km\n\n**Highway Section:**\n5. **‰∫¨ÊâøÈ´òÈÄü (Jingcheng Expressway)** - 21.4km\n6. **Â§ßÂ∫Ü-ÂπøÂ∑ûÈ´òÈÄüÂÖ¨Ë∑Ø (Daqing-Guangzhou Expressway)** - 17.9km\n7. **‰∫¨ÂØÜÈ´òÈÄü (Jingmi Expressway)** - 3.8km\n\n**Final Approach to Yanqihu Campus:**\n8. **ÊÄÄÈõÅË∑Ø (Huaiyan Road)** - 3.5km\n9. **‰∫¨Êº†Á∫ø (Jingmo Line)** - 4.1km\n\n### **Important Notes for Cyclists**\n‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Considerations:**\n- This route includes major highways and expressways which may **not be suitable or legal for bicycles**\n- The calculated route appears to follow car/motor vehicle paths\n- **Recommended:** Use dedicated bike lanes and local roads instead of highways\n\n### **Alternative Recommendations**\nFor a safer cycling experience, consider:\n1. **Using local roads and bike paths** parallel to the highways\n2. **Taking public transportation** for part of the journey (subway + bike)\n3. **Planning rest stops** as this is quite a long distance for cycling\n4. **Checking weather conditions** before departure\n5. **Bringing water, snacks, and repair tools** for the journey\n\n### **Estimated Realistic Cycling Time**\nWhile the routing algorithm suggests ~52 minutes, a more realistic estimate for recreational cycling on safe roads would be **2-3 hours**, considering:\n- Traffic lights and intersections\n- Rest breaks\n- Using safer, possibly longer routes\n- Average cycling speeds on urban roads\n\nWould you like me to help you find alternative transportation options or more detailed information about bike-friendly routes in Beijing?",

        "response": "I apologize, but I'm having difficulty accessing the current silver price through the available tools. However, I can provide you with a general estimate based on typical silver prices.\n\nAs of recent market conditions, silver typically trades around $20-25 per troy ounce. Since you have 18.9 grams of silver, let me calculate the estimated value:\n\n**Conversion and Calculation:**\n- 1 troy ounce = 31.1035 grams\n- Your 18.9g = 18.9 √∑ 31.1035 = approximately 0.608 troy ounces\n\n**Estimated Value Range:**\n- At $20/oz: 0.608 √ó $20 = approximately **$12.16**\n- At $25/oz: 0.608 √ó $25 = approximately **$15.20**\n\nSo your 18.9 grams of silver would be worth approximately **$12-15 USD**, depending on the current spot price and assuming it's pure silver.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- This is based on spot silver prices; actual selling prices may be lower due to dealer premiums and fees\n- The exact value depends on the purity of your silver (sterling silver is 92.5% pure, for example)\n- Market prices fluctuate throughout the day\n\nFor the most accurate current valuation, I'd recommend checking a precious metals dealer website or financial news source for today's silver spot price.",

However, I can provide you with a general estimate based on typical silver prices.\n\nAs of recent market conditions, silver typically trades around $20-25 per troy ounce. Since you have 18.9 grams of silver, let me calculate the estimated value:\n\n**Conversion and Calculation:**\n- 1 troy ounce = 31.1035 grams\n- Your 18.9g = 18.9 √∑ 31.1035 = approximately 0.608 troy ounces\n\n**Estimated Value Range:**\n- At $20/oz: 0.608 √ó $20 = approximately **$12.16**\n- At $25/oz: 0.608 √ó $25 = approximately **$15.20**\n\nSo your 18.9 grams of silver would be worth approximately **$12-15 USD**, depending on the current spot price and assuming it's pure silver.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- This is based on spot silver prices; actual selling prices may be lower due to dealer premiums and fees\n- The exact value depends on the purity of your silver (sterling silver is 92.5% pure, for example)\n- Market prices fluctuate throughout the day\n\nFor the most accurate current valuation, I'd recommend checking a precious metals dealer website or financial news source for today's silver spot price.",

The **RTX 5070 Ti** and **RX 9070 XT** offer the best balance of performance and value for enthusiast gaming, while the **RTX 5070** is excellent for 1440p gaming at a more reasonable price point.\n\nUnfortunately, Amazon's anti-bot protection prevented me from getting the exact product page URLs, but the search links above will take you directly to Amazon's graphics card listings for each model where you can find specific variants from different manufacturers like ASUS, MSI, EVGA, etc.",

The RTX 5060 Ti, RTX 5060, and [Radeon](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/radeon) RX 9060 XT have all launched in their various memory configurations, and that‚Äôs made for fierce competition in the more attainable end of the graphics market.\\\\n\\\\nA couple of older-gen GPUs still hang around at the very bottom of the barrel, like the Radeon RX 6600, the GeForce RTX 3050, and the Intel Arc A750, but those products are only likely to hang around until newer products take the torch from them.\\\\n\\\\nJuly 2025 Update\\\\n\\\\nWe have fully refreshed our list of the best graphics cards. Given current market conditions, we\\'ve trimmed down the number of selections and mostly opted for the latest generation products ‚Äî there\\'s often no sense in paying more for a slower previous-gen part. Everything is fully new for this update.\\\\n\\\\nNvidia is set to launch the RTX 5050 soon, bringing Blackwell all the way down to the $249 price point, but its early performance numbers don‚Äôt look earth-shattering. AMD hasn‚Äôt announced any plans for an RX 9050 yet, but it‚Äôs not a stretch to imagine one might be in the works. You can still grab an Arc A750 for $200 if you have no other options, but we recently revisited it and found that it‚Äôs still a somewhat compromised product.\\\\n\\\\nAs for the rest of the market, on-shelf prices range from the usual premiums over MSRP to eye-watering markups that nobody should pay. At least you can still buy most any graphics card from stock at some price point, unlike the worst days of the crypto crunch, where shelves were totally bare and restocks created a mad rush for anything available.\\\\n\\\\nTariff uncertainty and silicon supply constraints from the AI boom haven‚Äôt eased, so outside of isolated sales, we expect these elevated prices to be the state of things for the foreseeable future. If nothing else, that stability makes it easy for us to make confident recommendations. Here goes.\\\\n\\\\n### Best graphics cards for gaming, at a glance\\\\n\\\\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\\\\n\\\\nThe Best Graphics Cards at a Glance\\\\n\\\\n| Graphics Card | 1080p FPS | 1440p FPS | 4K FPS | Price (MSRP) | Avg.

Retail prices can fluctuate quite a lot right now; the table lists the best we could find at the time of writing.*\\\\n\\\\n*In general, when discussing pricing, we\\'ve tried to use the median of current on-shelf prices, not MSRPs, to evaluate our choices. We think this midpoint is most likely to represent a card with a nice cooler that you can find in stock, not a stripped-down model that\\'s rarely restocked and exists only to hit MSRP.*\\\\n\\\\n*If you can find a card for less than this median price, it\\'s a better value, and if one is more expensive, you will need to think about whether it\\'s beginning to shadow a more expensive product. For example, an expensive RTX 5070 might approach the cost of a faster Radeon RX 9070 XT, and thus would be a sub-optimal buy.*\\\\n\\\\n*Also note that the \\\\\"average power draw\\\\\" column is the* **average power across all of our testing for each GPU** *‚Äî so the 5090 in particular uses far less power when it\\'s CPU limited at 1080p, and that skews the overall average down.*\\\\n\\\\nThe above list shows all the latest generation graphics cards we feel stand out in their segments. We\\'ve basically eliminated all but the least expensive last-generation graphics cards. Those parts will be most appealing to potential budget builders, as well as anyone who just needs a modest card to get by until prices come down (which might take a while). If you want to see how *all* of the current and prior generation GPUs stack up, check our [GPU benchmarks hierarchy](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html).\\\\n\\\\nThe overall performance ranking incorporates 21 games from our updated test suite, which takes the geometric mean (i.e. equal weighting) for both rasterization and ray tracing games. Note that we are *not* including any upscaling or frame generation results in the table, which can skew things a lot depending on the selection of games and what \\\\\"performance enhancing drug\\\\\" versions are supported.\\\\n\\\\nThe short summary: DLSS 4 offers superior image fidelity to other upscaling tech, and its transformer AI model works with cards going all the way back to the RTX 20-series. DLSS 3 and DLSS 2 offer similar upscaling quality, but Nvidia will allow you to force DLSS 4 in some older titles through the Nvidia App utility if you\\'d like the latest and greatest.\\\\n\\\\nRTX 50-series GPUs are Nvidia\\'s first with support for with multi-frame generation (MFG), which allows Blackwell GPUs to insert three or four AI-generated intermediate frames between each native one. RTX 40-series GPUs also support framegen, but only with a 2X boost.\\\\n\\\\nFSR 4 offers AI-enhanced upscaling, but only for RX 9000-series AMD cards. AMD\\'s FSR 3.1 and earlier upscalers still work on *any* GPU, but the image quality tends to be noticeably lower.\\\\n\\\\nFSR framegen didn\\'t get an AI enhancement with the move to FSR 4. Its framerate-doubling boost remains cross-compatible with GPUs from all vendors, but its image quality also remains unchanged from prior generations.\\\\n\\\\nIntel XeSS 2 with AI-enhanced frame generation isn\\'t widely supported yet and requires an Arc GPU, while XeSS 1.3.1 upscaling can be superior to FSR 3.x but isn\\'t used in as many games as FSR or DLSS. XeSS Frame Generation, like FSR, only supports a doubling of frame rates at best.\\\\n\\\\nWhile performance can be an important criteria for a lot of gamers, it\\'s not the only metric that matters. Our subjective rankings below factor in price, power, and features colored by our own years of experience. Others may offer a slightly different take, but all of the cards on this list are worthy of your consideration.\\\\n\\\\n### 1.

Even at today\\'s elevated prices, it delivers raw performance within spitting distance of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti for much less money.\\\\n\\\\nAMD shored up two of its greatest weaknesses against Nvidia in the past with the RX 9070 XT\\'s RDNA 4 architecture: RT performance and AI acceleration, both of which are now much closer to Nvidia\\'s latest and greatest. And AMD did all that while keeping power efficiency right there with Nvidia, too.\\\\n\\\\nThe FSR4 upscaler is a big jump in image quality over FSR 3, and as it rolls out to more and more games, the RX 9070 XT\\'s star will only grow brighter. AMD‚Äôs FSR 3 frame generation soldiers on without any AI upgrades, though, and it can still only perform 2X framegen, not the 3X or 4X you get with Nvidia‚Äôs MFG.\\\\n\\\\nWhether you\\'re gaming at 1080p, 1440p, or 4K, the 9070 XT has the power to get you there, all for a fairly reasonable price in today\\'s weird world of graphics. We wish more of these cards were selling for closer to AMD‚Äôs $599 MSRP, but that‚Äôs about all we can complain about with it.\\\\n\\\\nIf you can find a GeForce RTX 5070 Ti close to its $749 MSRP, the balance would definitely shift in favor of Nvidia\\'s card, but as the market stands today, the RX 9070 XT offers the best balance of price, performance, and efficiency for enthusiasts who don\\'t have unlimited budgets.\\\\n\\\\n**Read:** [**AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT review**](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review)\\\\n\\\\n### 2.

It\\'s easy to find one for about the same price as or less than a Radeon RX 9070 goes for right now, making AMD‚Äôs second-highest-end RDNA 4 card a harder sell than its XT sibling.\\\\n\\\\nThe RTX 5070 brings a strong triple threat to this price point: enough raster and ray-tracing performance at 1440p to natively push high-resolution monitors, plus Nvidia\\'s superior DLSS 4 upscaling and unique multi-frame generation capability. Unlike the pricey RTX 5070 Ti, we think those factors are too compelling to ignore when the RTX 5070 is pitted against the RX 9070, dollar for dollar.\\\\n\\\\nIf more RX 9070s sold for closer to AMD‚Äôs $549 MSRP, we‚Äôd have to give it top billing in this space. But the second-best RDNA 4 card sells for prices that are only a bit lower than the cheapest RX 9070 XT right now, so if you‚Äôre already considering a 9070, there‚Äôs really no reason to do anything but step up to one of the cheaper RX 9070 XTs out there for a relatively small premium.\\\\n\\\\nBy the same logic, we‚Äôd also try to stick to the cheaper end of the RTX 5070s, since the 9070 XT is 14% faster than the Nvidia middleweight. $600 RTX 5070s are a far more common sight than $600 RX 9070s, so this isn‚Äôt a hard task.\\\\n\\\\nThe RTX 5070\\'s 12GB of VRAM means it may have less longevity than the RX 9070 and its 16GB of VRAM, but if you\\'re not trying to push the limits with a 4K monitor or heavy ray-tracing, we think it\\'s an OK tradeoff for now. DLSS 4 upscaling means you can generally get away with lower internal resolutions than other upscalers, too, potentially reducing VRAM pressure even if you do want to target higher output resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want a solid foundation for 1440p gaming and the option to enable all of Nvidia‚Äôs DLSS 4 tech at will for a reasonable price, the RTX 5070 is the best way to get there right now.\\\\n\\\\n**Read:** [**Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 review**](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-founders-edition)\\\\n\\\\n### 3.

Let me try to get the direct Amazon links that were mentioned in the Tom's Hardware article, as they included some Amazon search links in their recommendations table.\n\nBased on the information I was able to gather from Tom's Hardware, here are the **top 5 best-selling/recommended GPUs** currently available, along with the Amazon search links that were provided in the article:\n\n## Top 5 Best GPUs (Based on Current Market Performance & Recommendations)\n\n### 1. **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090** - $3,000 (MSRP: $2,000)\n- **Performance**: 157 FPS at 1080p, 141.8 FPS at 1440p, 102 FPS at 4K\n- **Amazon Link**: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=GeForce+RTX+5090&rh=n%3A17923671011%2Cn%3A284822\n\n### 2. **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti** - $930 (MSRP: $750)\n- **Performance**: 123.7 FPS at 1080p, 98.5 FPS at 1440p, 58.8 FPS at 4K\n- **Amazon Link**: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=GeForce+RTX+5070+Ti&rh=n%3A17923671011%2Cn%3A284822\n\n### 3. **AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT** - $800 (MSRP: $600)\n- **Performance**: 118 FPS at 1080p, 94.1 FPS at 1440p, 57.0 FPS at 4K\n- **Amazon Link**: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Radeon+RX+9070+XT&rh=n%3A17923671011%2Cn%3A284822\n\n### 4. **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070** - $650 (MSRP: $550)\n- **Performance**: 105.3 FPS at 1080p, 78.2 FPS at 1440p, 44.8 FPS at 4K\n- **Amazon Link**: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=GeForce+RTX+5070&rh=n%3A17923671011%2Cn%3A284822\n\n### 5. **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB** - $490 (MSRP: $429)\n- **Performance**: 82.0 FPS at 1080p, 59.7 FPS at 1440p, 33.5 FPS at 4K\n- **Direct Amazon Link**: https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Graphics-WINDFORCE-GV-N506TGAMING-OC-16GD/dp/B0F5BD1X83\n\n## Important Notes:\n- **Pricing**: Current retail prices are significantly higher than MSRP due to tariff uncertainty and supply constraints\n- **Availability**: Stock levels vary, and some cards may be marked up considerably\n- **Performance**: These rankings are based on raw performance across 21 games at different resolutions\n- **Features**: NVIDIA cards support DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, while AMD cards support the new FSR 4 AI upscaling\n\nThe RTX 5090 is the absolute performance king but extremely expensive. The **RTX 5070 Ti** and **RX 9070 XT** offer the best balance of performance and value for enthusiast gaming, while the **RTX 5070** is excellent for 1440p gaming at a more reasonable price point.\n\nUnfortunately, Amazon's anti-bot protection prevented me from getting the exact product page URLs, but the search links above will take you directly to Amazon's graphics card listings for each model where you can find specific variants from different manufacturers like ASUS, MSI, EVGA, etc.",

Here's what I've provided:\n\n## Foundational Overview of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n\nBased on Wikipedia's comprehensive article, here are the key foundational concepts:\n\n### **What are CNNs?**\n- **Definition**: CNNs are feedforward neural networks that learn features via filter (kernel) optimization\n- **Primary Use**: De-facto standard for computer vision and image processing tasks\n- **Data Types**: Applied to images, text, audio, and other data types\n\n### **Key Architectural Components**\n1. **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters/kernels for feature extraction using shared weights\n2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions and computational complexity\n3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Final classification or regression layers\n4. **Activation Functions**: Typically ReLU for non-linearity\n\n### **Fundamental Advantages**\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: Dramatically reduces parameters compared to fully connected networks\n  - Example: 25 weights per convolutional layer vs 10,000 weights for equivalent fully connected processing\n- **Regularization**: Shared weights prevent overfitting and vanishing/exploding gradients\n- **Hierarchical Learning**: Lower layers learn basic features, higher layers learn complex patterns\n- **Spatial Awareness**: Preserves spatial relationships in data\n\n### **Applications** (per Wikipedia)\n- Image and video recognition\n- Image classification and segmentation\n- Medical image analysis\n- Natural language processing\n- Brain-computer interfaces\n- Financial time series analysis\n- Recommender systems\n\n## Python Script: `/root/code/cnn_example.py`\n\nI've created a comprehensive CNN implementation that includes:\n\n### **Features of the Script:**\n1. **Complete CNN Class**: `SimpleCNN` with all essential methods\n2. **Architecture**: 3 convolutional blocks + fully connected layers\n3. **Dataset**: Uses CIFAR-10 (10 classes, 32x32 color images)\n4. **Training Pipeline**: Complete training, validation, and evaluation\n5. **Visualization**: Training history plots and model summary\n6. **Educational Comments**: Explains each component with Wikipedia references\n\n### **Key Components Demonstrated:**\n- **Filter Optimization**: Multiple convolutional layers with increasing filter counts\n- **Shared Weights**: Demonstrated through parameter count comparisons\n- **Regularization**: Dropout layers and batch normalization\n- **Hierarchical Features**: Progressive feature extraction through deeper layers\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: Shows dramatic reduction vs fully connected networks\n\n### **Usage:**\n```bash\ncd /root/code\npython cnn_example.py\n```\n\n### **Requirements:**\n- TensorFlow\n- Matplotlib\n- Scikit-learn\n- NumPy\n\nThe script provides both theoretical understanding and practical implementation, making it an excellent educational resource for learning CNNs while referencing Wikipedia's foundational concepts.",

However, I noticed the routing service returned identical durations for all transportation modes, which appears to be a technical issue with the service. Let me provide you with a comprehensive analysis based on the route data and realistic travel time estimates:\n\n## **Detailed Commute Analysis: Nanjing West Road to Jin Mao Tower**\n\n### **üìç Route Overview**\n- **Distance:** 5.77 km (5,768 meters)\n- **Main Route:** The route takes you through central Shanghai, crossing the Huangpu River via the Yan'an East Road Tunnel\n- **Key Roads:** Weihai Road ‚Üí Chengdu North Road ‚Üí Yan'an East Road ‚Üí Yan'an East Road Tunnel ‚Üí Century Avenue ‚Üí Lujiazui area\n\n### **üöó Driving Analysis**\n- **Estimated Time (8:00 AM Rush Hour):** 20-35 minutes\n- **Distance:** 5.77 km\n- **Key Considerations:**\n  - Morning rush hour significantly impacts travel time\n  - Yan'an East Road Tunnel can be congested during peak hours\n  - Parking at Jin Mao Tower area is expensive (typically ¬•10-20/hour)\n  - Traffic density increases as you approach Lujiazui financial district\n\n### **üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Walking Analysis**\n- **Estimated Time:** 65-75 minutes\n- **Distance:** 5.77 km\n- **Key Considerations:**\n  - Long walk through urban Shanghai\n  - Crosses Huangpu River via tunnel (pedestrian walkway available)\n  - Weather dependency (hot summers, cold winters)\n  - Good exercise opportunity but time-consuming for daily commute\n\n### **üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Biking Analysis**\n- **Estimated Time:** 25-35 minutes\n- **Distance:** 5.77 km\n- **Key Considerations:**\n  - Shanghai has extensive bike lane infrastructure\n  - Tunnel crossing allows bicycles\n  - Weather-dependent option\n  - Need secure bike parking at Jin Mao Tower\n  - Cost-effective and environmentally friendly\n\n### **üöá Public Transportation Alternative** \n*(Highly Recommended)*\nWhile not included in the original analysis, public transport would likely be your best option:\n- **Metro Route:** Line 2 from Nanjing West Road Station to Lujiazui Station\n- **Estimated Time:** 15-25 minutes including walking to/from stations\n- **Cost:** ~¬•4-6 per trip\n- **Reliability:** High, less affected by weather and traffic\n\n### **üí° Recommendations**\n\n1. **Best Overall Option:** Metro Line 2 (if you're near the station)\n2. **Backup Option:** Biking (good for nice weather days)\n3. **Occasional Use:** Driving (for bad weather or when carrying heavy items)\n4. **Not Recommended:** Walking (too time-consuming for daily commute)\n\n### **üïê Rush Hour Impact**\nDeparting at 8:00 AM puts you right in Shanghai's morning rush hour (7:30-9:00 AM). This significantly affects:\n- **Driving:** +50-100% travel time increase\n- **Biking:** +15-25% travel time increase\n- **Walking:** Minimal impact\n- **Metro:** +20-30% travel time increase due to crowding\n\n### **üìä Summary Comparison**\n| Mode | Time | Cost/Day | Weather Impact | Reliability |\n|------|------|----------|----------------|-------------|\n| Driving | 20-35 min | ¬•50-80 | Low | Medium |\n| Walking | 65-75 min | ¬•0 | High | High |\n| Biking | 25-35 min | ¬•0 | High | Medium |\n| Metro | 15-25 min | ¬•8-12 | Low | High |\n\nThe apartment location offers reasonable commute options to Jin Mao Tower, with the Metro being the most practical choice for daily commuting, supplemented by biking for pleasant weather days.",

However, I noticed the routing service returned identical durations for all transportation modes, which appears to be a technical issue with the service. Let me provide you with a comprehensive analysis based on the route data and realistic travel time estimates:\n\n## **Detailed Commute Analysis: Nanjing West Road to Jin Mao Tower**\n\n### **üìç Route Overview**\n- **Distance:** 5.77 km (5,768 meters)\n- **Main Route:** The route takes you through central Shanghai, crossing the Huangpu River via the Yan'an East Road Tunnel\n- **Key Roads:** Weihai Road ‚Üí Chengdu North Road ‚Üí Yan'an East Road ‚Üí Yan'an East Road Tunnel ‚Üí Century Avenue ‚Üí Lujiazui area\n\n### **üöó Driving Analysis**\n- **Estimated Time (8:00 AM Rush Hour):** 20-35 minutes\n- **Distance:** 5.77 km\n- **Key Considerations:**\n  - Morning rush hour significantly impacts travel time\n  - Yan'an East Road Tunnel can be congested during peak hours\n  - Parking at Jin Mao Tower area is expensive (typically ¬•10-20/hour)\n  - Traffic density increases as you approach Lujiazui financial district\n\n### **üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Walking Analysis**\n- **Estimated Time:** 65-75 minutes\n- **Distance:** 5.77 km\n- **Key Considerations:**\n  - Long walk through urban Shanghai\n  - Crosses Huangpu River via tunnel (pedestrian walkway available)\n  - Weather dependency (hot summers, cold winters)\n  - Good exercise opportunity but time-consuming for daily commute\n\n### **üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Biking Analysis**\n- **Estimated Time:** 25-35 minutes\n- **Distance:** 5.77 km\n- **Key Considerations:**\n  - Shanghai has extensive bike lane infrastructure\n  - Tunnel crossing allows bicycles\n  - Weather-dependent option\n  - Need secure bike parking at Jin Mao Tower\n  - Cost-effective and environmentally friendly\n\n### **üöá Public Transportation Alternative** \n*(Highly Recommended)*\nWhile not included in the original analysis, public transport would likely be your best option:\n- **Metro Route:** Line 2 from Nanjing West Road Station to Lujiazui Station\n- **Estimated Time:** 15-25 minutes including walking to/from stations\n- **Cost:** ~¬•4-6 per trip\n- **Reliability:** High, less affected by weather and traffic\n\n### **üí° Recommendations**\n\n1. **Best Overall Option:** Metro Line 2 (if you're near the station)\n2. **Backup Option:** Biking (good for nice weather days)\n3. **Occasional Use:** Driving (for bad weather or when carrying heavy items)\n4. **Not Recommended:** Walking (too time-consuming for daily commute)\n\n### **üïê Rush Hour Impact**\nDeparting at 8:00 AM puts you right in Shanghai's morning rush hour (7:30-9:00 AM). This significantly affects:\n- **Driving:** +50-100% travel time increase\n- **Biking:** +15-25% travel time increase\n- **Walking:** Minimal impact\n- **Metro:** +20-30% travel time increase due to crowding\n\n### **üìä Summary Comparison**\n| Mode | Time | Cost/Day | Weather Impact | Reliability |\n|------|------|----------|----------------|-------------|\n| Driving | 20-35 min | ¬•50-80 | Low | Medium |\n| Walking | 65-75 min | ¬•0 | High | High |\n| Biking | 25-35 min | ¬•0 | High | Medium |\n| Metro | 15-25 min | ¬•8-12 | Low | High |\n\nThe apartment location offers reasonable commute options to Jin Mao Tower, with the Metro being the most practical choice for daily commuting, supplemented by biking for pleasant weather days.",

In fact, most of the recent coverage appears to be neutral to positive:\n\n**Recent Headlines:**\n1. **\"Top Cryptocurrencies Mixed; Bitcoin Holds Above $116,000\"** (MT Newswires) - This indicates Bitcoin is maintaining strong price levels above $116K.\n\n2. **\"Solana Takes the Altcoin Rally Baton as ETH, XRP, BTC Stall\"** (CoinDesk) - While this mentions BTC \"stalling,\" it's more about altcoins outperforming rather than negative Bitcoin news specifically.\n\n3. **\"Asia Morning Briefing: U.S. BTC ETF Inflows Dwarf Hong Kong's as Local Investors Stick With Stocks\"** (CoinDesk) - This is actually positive news about strong U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows.\n\n4. **\"Strategy Aims to Raise Another $500M for Bitcoin Buys With New Preferred Series\"** (CoinDesk) - This is positive news about institutional Bitcoin investment.\n\n5. **\"Altcoin Season Returns as Ether Treasuries Surge, BTC Dominance Slips\"** (CoinDesk) - While mentioning BTC dominance slipping, this is more about the broader altcoin market gaining momentum rather than negative Bitcoin-specific news.\n\n## Summary\n\nCurrently, there doesn't appear to be any significant negative news about Bitcoin in recent headlines. The sentiment remains in \"Greed\" territory according to the Fear & Greed Index, and most news coverage focuses on Bitcoin maintaining high price levels above $116,000, strong ETF inflows, and institutional investment interest. The main story is that altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin, but this is typical market rotation behavior rather than negative Bitcoin sentiment.",

In fact, most of the recent coverage appears to be neutral to positive:\n\n**Recent Headlines:**\n1. **\"Top Cryptocurrencies Mixed; Bitcoin Holds Above $116,000\"** (MT Newswires) - This indicates Bitcoin is maintaining strong price levels above $116K.\n\n2. **\"Solana Takes the Altcoin Rally Baton as ETH, XRP, BTC Stall\"** (CoinDesk) - While this mentions BTC \"stalling,\" it's more about altcoins outperforming rather than negative Bitcoin news specifically.\n\n3. **\"Asia Morning Briefing: U.S. BTC ETF Inflows Dwarf Hong Kong's as Local Investors Stick With Stocks\"** (CoinDesk) - This is actually positive news about strong U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows.\n\n4. **\"Strategy Aims to Raise Another $500M for Bitcoin Buys With New Preferred Series\"** (CoinDesk) - This is positive news about institutional Bitcoin investment.\n\n5. **\"Altcoin Season Returns as Ether Treasuries Surge, BTC Dominance Slips\"** (CoinDesk) - While mentioning BTC dominance slipping, this is more about the broader altcoin market gaining momentum rather than negative Bitcoin-specific news.\n\n## Summary\n\nCurrently, there doesn't appear to be any significant negative news about Bitcoin in recent headlines. The sentiment remains in \"Greed\" territory according to the Fear & Greed Index, and most news coverage focuses on Bitcoin maintaining high price levels above $116,000, strong ETF inflows, and institutional investment interest. The main story is that altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin, but this is typical market rotation behavior rather than negative Bitcoin sentiment.",

One commenter (JoelJacobson) provided detailed benchmarks showing linear scaling problems - with 1,000 idle listeners, latency increases from ~0.4ms to ~14ms\n- **Connection Pooling Problems**: Several commenters note that LISTEN/NOTIFY doesn't work well with connection poolers, limiting scalability\n- **Locking Behavior**: The AccessExclusiveLock behavior during transactions is identified as a major bottleneck\n\n### **Alternative Approaches Suggested**\n1. **Message Queues**: Kafka, NATS, and RabbitMQ are frequently mentioned as better alternatives for pub/sub scenarios\n2. **WAL Listening**: Multiple commenters suggest listening to PostgreSQL's Write-Ahead Log (WAL) instead of using LISTEN/NOTIFY\n3. **Polling Methods**: Some suggest \"dumb polling\" with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED as potentially more efficient\n4. **Specialized Tools**: Centrifugo and other real-time messaging systems are recommended for high-concurrency scenarios\n\n### **Architecture Philosophy Divide**\n- **\"Use PostgreSQL for Everything\" vs. Specialized Tools**: There's a clear split between those who prefer keeping everything in PostgreSQL and those advocating for specialized components\n- **Hybrid Approaches**: Several commenters suggest using PostgreSQL alongside complementary tools like ClickHouse for analytics and NATS for messaging\n\n### **Practical Concerns**\n- **Implementation Issues**: Comments highlight that many developers may be \"using it wrong\" - sending NOTIFYs for every transaction instead of batching/debouncing them\n- **Business Context**: Some commenters criticized the original post for not explaining the actual business requirements that led to using LISTEN/NOTIFY\n- **Migration Difficulty**: Concerns about getting locked into PostgreSQL-specific features that are hard to migrate away from\n\n### **Real-World Experience**\n- **Scale Examples**: One commenter shared experience with a messaging app serving 2 million concurrent connections using Redis instead of RabbitMQ\n- **Framework Issues**: Elixir's Oban framework had consistent problems with LISTEN/NOTIFY due to payload limitations and connection pooler issues\n\n## Overall Consensus\nThe community generally agrees that while PostgreSQL is excellent for many use cases, LISTEN/NOTIFY has significant limitations for high-scale, real-time applications. The recommendation is to use specialized pub/sub systems for such scenarios while keeping PostgreSQL for what it does best - relational data operations.",

Comment by osigurdson (ID: 44527817):\\\\n   I like this article. Lots of comments are stating that they are &quot;using it wrong&quot; and I&#x27;m sure they are. However, it does help to contrast the much more common, &quot;use Postgres for everything&quot; type sentiment. It is pretty hard to use Postgres wrong for relational things in the sense that everyone knows about indexes and so on. But using something like L&#x2F;N comes with a separate learning curve anyway - evidenced in this case by someone having to read comments in the Postgres source code itself. Then if it turns out that it cannot work for your situation it may be very hard to back away from as you may have tightly integrated it with your normal Postgres stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve landed on Postgres&#x2F;ClickHouse&#x2F;NATS since together they handle nearly any conceivable workload managing relational, columnar, messaging&#x2F;streaming very well. It is also not painful at all to use as it is lightweight and fast&#x2F;easy to spin up in a simple docker compose. Postgres is of course the core and you don&#x27;t always need all three but compliment each other very well imo. This has been my &quot;go to&quot; for a while.\\\\n\\\\n2. Comment by sorentwo (ID: 44525509):\\\\n   Postgres LISTEN&#x2F;NOTIFY was a consistent pain point for Oban (background job processing framework for Elixir) for a while. The payload size limitations and connection pooler issues alone would cause subtle breakage.<p>It was particularly ironic because Elixir has a fantastic distribution and pubsub story thanks to distributed Erlang. That‚Äôs much more commonly used in apps now compared to 5 or so years ago when 40-50% of apps didn‚Äôt weren‚Äôt clustered.  Thanks to the rise of platforms like Fly that made it easier, and the decline of Heroku that made it nearly impossible.\\\\n\\\\n3. Comment by JoelJacobson (ID: 44530687):\\\\n   Hey folks, I ran into similar scalability issues and ended up building a benchmark tool to analyze exactly how LISTEN&#x2F;NOTIFY behaves as you scale up the number of listeners.<p>Turns out that all Postgres versions from 9.6 through current master scale linearly with the number of idle listeners ‚Äî about 13 Œºs extra latency per connection. That adds up fast: with 1,000 idle listeners, a NOTIFY round-trip goes from ~0.4 ms to ~14 ms.<p>To better understand the bottlenecks, I wrote both a benchmark tool and a proof-of-concept patch that replaces the O(N) backend scan with a shared hash table for the single-listener case ‚Äî and it brings latency down to near-O(1), even with thousands of listeners.<p>Full benchmark, source, and analysis here:\\\\n <a href=\\\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joelonsql&#x2F;pg-bench-listen-notify\\\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joelonsql&#x2F;pg-bench-listen-notify</a><p>No proposals yet on what to do upstream, just trying to gather interest and surface the performance cliff. Feedback welcome.\\\\n\\\\n4. Comment by leontrolski (ID: 44525560):\\\\n   I&#x27;d be interested as to how dumb-ol&#x27; polling would compare here (the FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED method <a href=\\\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leontrolski.github.io&#x2F;postgres-as-queue.html\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leontrolski.github.io&#x2F;postgres-as-queue.html</a>). One day I will set up some benchmarks as this is the kind of thing people argue about a lot without much evidence either way.<p>Wasn&#x27;t aware of this AccessExclusiveLock behaviour - a reminder (and shameless plug 2) of how Postgres locks interact: <a href=\\\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leontrolski.github.io&#x2F;pglockpy.html\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leontrolski.github.io&#x2F;pglockpy.html</a>\\\\n\\\\n5. Comment by cpursley (ID: 44525353):\\\\n   Right, plus there&#x27;s character limitations (column size). This is why I prefer listening to the Postgres WAL for database changes:<p><a href=\\\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpursley&#x2F;walex?tab=readme-ov-file#walex\\\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpursley&#x2F;walex?tab=readme-ov-file#walex</a> (there&#x27;s a few useful links in here)\\\\n\\\\n6. Comment by FZambia (ID: 44531732):\\\\n   Many here recommend using Kafka or RabbitMQ for real-time notifications. While these tools work well with a relatively stable, limited set of topics, they become costly and inefficient when dealing with a large number of dynamic subscribers, such as in a messaging app where users frequently come and go. In RabbitMQ, queue bindings are resource-intensive, and in Kafka, creating new subscriptions often triggers expensive rebalancing operations. I&#x27;ve seen a use case for a messenger app with 100k concurrent subscribers where developers used RabbitMQ and individual queues for each user. It worked at 60 CPU on Rabbit side during normal situation and during mass reconnections of users (due to some proxy reload in infra) ‚Äì it took up to several minutes for users to reconnect. I suggested switching to <a href=\\\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;centrifugal&#x2F;centrifugo\\\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;centrifugal&#x2F;centrifugo</a> with Redis engine (combines PUB&#x2F;SUB + Redis streams for individual queues) ‚Äì and it went to 0.3 CPU on Redis side. Now the system serves about 2 million concurrent connections.\\\\n\\\\n7. Comment by CaliforniaKarl (ID: 44525375):\\\\n   I appreciate this post for two reasons:<p>* It gives an indication of how much you need to grow before this Postgres functionality starts being a blocker.<p>* Folks encountering this issue‚Äîand its confusing log line‚Äîin the future will be able to find this post and quickly understand the issue.\\\\n\\\\n8. Comment by andrewstuart (ID: 44525490):\\\\n   There‚Äôs lots of ways to invoke NOTIFY without doing it from with the transaction doing the work.<p>The post author is too focused on using NOTIFY in only one way.<p>This post fails to explain WHY they are sending a NOTIFY. Not much use telling us what doesn‚Äôt work without telling us the actual business goal.<p>It‚Äôs crazy to send a notify for every transaction, they should be debounced&#x2F;grouped.<p>The point of a NOTIFY is to let some other system know something has changed. Don‚Äôt do it every transaction.\\\\n\\\\n9. Comment by hombre_fatal (ID: 44525152):\\\\n   Interesting. What if you just execute `NOTIFY` in its own connection outside of &#x2F; after the transaction?\\\\n\\\\n10. Comment by callamdelaney (ID: 44526788):\\\\n   My kneejerk reaction to the headline is ‚Äòwhy would it?‚Äô.<p>It‚Äôs unsurprising to me that an AI company appears to have chosen exactly the wrong tool for the job.\\\\n\\\\n11. Comment by NightMKoder (ID: 44525446):\\\\n   Facebook‚Äôs wormhole seems like a better approach here - just tailing the MySQL bin log gets you commit safety for messages without running into this kind of locking behavior.\\\\n\\\\n12. Comment by cshimmin (ID: 44525555):\\\\n   If I understood correctly, the global lock is so that notify events are emitted in order. Would it make sense to have a variant that doesn&#x27;t make this ordering guarantee if you don&#x27;t care about it, so that you can &quot;notify&quot; within transactions without locking the whole thing?\\\\n\\\\n13. Comment by bjornsing (ID: 44529138):\\\\n   If I‚Äôm not mistaken LISTEN&#x2F;NOTIFY doesn‚Äôt work with connection poolers, and you can‚Äôt have tens of thousands of connections to a Postgres database. Not sure you need a more elaborate analysis than that to reach the same conclusion.\\\\n\\\\n14. Comment by baristaGeek (ID: 44528160):\\\\n   Postgres is a great DB, but it&#x27;s the wrong tool for a write-heavy, high-concurrency, real-time system with pub-sub needs.<p>You should split your system into specialized components:\\\\n- Kafka for event transport (you&#x27;re likely already doing this).\\\\n- An LSM-tree DB for write-heavy structured data (eg: Cassandra)\\\\n- Keep Postgres for queries that benefit from relational features in certain parts of your architecture\\\\n\\\\n15. Comment by merb (ID: 44528939):\\\\n   Wouldn‚Äôt it be better nowadays to listen to the Wal. With a temporary replication slot and a publication just for this table and the id column?\\\\n\\\\n16. Comment by polote (ID: 44525307):\\\\n   Rls and triggers dont scale either\\\\n\\\\n17. Comment by shivasaxena (ID: 44525717):\\\\n   Out of curiosity: Would appreciate if others can share what other things like AccessExclusiveLock should postgres users beware of?<p>What I already know<p>- Unique indexes slow inserts since db has to acquire a full table lock<p>- Case statements in Where break query planner&#x2F;optimizer and require full table scans<p>- Read only postgres functions should be marked as `STABLE\\\\nPARALLEL SAFE`\\\\n\\\\n18. Comment by FZambia (ID: 44531352):\\\\n   For real-time notifications, I believe Nats (<a href=\\\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nats.io\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nats.io</a>) or Centrifugo (<a href=\\\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;centrifugal.dev\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;centrifugal.dev</a>) are worth checking out these days. Messages may be delivered to those systems from PostgreSQL over replication protocol through Kafka as an intermediary buffer. Reliable real-time messaging comes with lots of complexities though, like late message delivery, duplicate message delivery. If the system can be built around at most once guarantees ‚Äì can help to simplify the design dramatically. Depends on the use case of course, often both at least once and at most once should co-exist in one app.\\\\n\\\\n19. Comment by spoaceman7777 (ID: 44527674):\\\\n   This is part of the basis for Supabase offering their realtime service, and broadcast, rather than supporting native LISTEN&#x2F;NOTIFY. The scaling issues are well known.\\\\n\\\\n20. Comment by mattxxx (ID: 44533394):\\\\n   The article is good, but maybe a bit negative on the postgres feature. I think the article reads much better with the slant:<p><pre><code"

                "content": "Based on the comments I've retrieved from Hacker News story 44490510, here's a summary of the key views and perspectives shared by the community:\n\n## Main Theme\nThe story discusses scalability issues with PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY feature, and the comments reveal a rich discussion about database architecture choices and alternatives.\n\n## Key Viewpoints:\n\n### **PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY Limitations**\n- **Performance Issues**: Multiple users confirm LISTEN/NOTIFY doesn't scale well. One commenter (JoelJacobson) provided detailed benchmarks showing linear scaling problems - with 1,000 idle listeners, latency increases from ~0.4ms to ~14ms\n- **Connection Pooling Problems**: Several commenters note that LISTEN/NOTIFY doesn't work well with connection poolers, limiting scalability\n- **Locking Behavior**: The AccessExclusiveLock behavior during transactions is identified as a major bottleneck\n\n### **Alternative Approaches Suggested**\n1. **Message Queues**: Kafka, NATS, and RabbitMQ are frequently mentioned as better alternatives for pub/sub scenarios\n2. **WAL Listening**: Multiple commenters suggest listening to PostgreSQL's Write-Ahead Log (WAL) instead of using LISTEN/NOTIFY\n3. **Polling Methods**: Some suggest \"dumb polling\" with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED as potentially more efficient\n4. **Specialized Tools**: Centrifugo and other real-time messaging systems are recommended for high-concurrency scenarios\n\n### **Architecture Philosophy Divide**\n- **\"Use PostgreSQL for Everything\" vs. Specialized Tools**: There's a clear split between those who prefer keeping everything in PostgreSQL and those advocating for specialized components\n- **Hybrid Approaches**: Several commenters suggest using PostgreSQL alongside complementary tools like ClickHouse for analytics and NATS for messaging\n\n### **Practical Concerns**\n- **Implementation Issues**: Comments highlight that many developers may be \"using it wrong\" - sending NOTIFYs for every transaction instead of batching/debouncing them\n- **Business Context**: Some commenters criticized the original post for not explaining the actual business requirements that led to using LISTEN/NOTIFY\n- **Migration Difficulty**: Concerns about getting locked into PostgreSQL-specific features that are hard to migrate away from\n\n### **Real-World Experience**\n- **Scale Examples**: One commenter shared experience with a messaging app serving 2 million concurrent connections using Redis instead of RabbitMQ\n- **Framework Issues**: Elixir's Oban framework had consistent problems with LISTEN/NOTIFY due to payload limitations and connection pooler issues\n\n## Overall Consensus\nThe community generally agrees that while PostgreSQL is excellent for many use cases, LISTEN/NOTIFY has significant limitations for high-scale, real-time applications. The recommendation is to use specialized pub/sub systems for such scenarios while keeping PostgreSQL for what it does best - relational data operations.",

If you need to access your Amazon account, go directly to **amazon.com** by typing it in your browser\n4. Consider reporting this phishing attempt to Amazon and your email provider\n5. Never enter your account information through links in emails - always navigate to the official website directly\n\nThis is definitely a phishing attempt designed to steal your Amazon credentials. Stay safe by always being suspicious of emails asking for account information, especially when they contain suspicious domains like this one.",

What was once the most powerful civilization in the ancient world gradually lost central political control, with its vast territory eventually divided among several successor states. The traditional date marking this collapse is 476 CE, when the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed. However, the causes behind this monumental fall have been debated by historians for centuries, with over 200 different theories proposed to explain this pivotal moment in world history.\\n\\n## Main Causes Recognized by Historians\\n\\n### 1. Military Decline and Barbarian Invasions\\n\\n**The Cause:** The Roman military, once the most formidable force in the ancient world, experienced significant decline in both effectiveness and numbers. Simultaneously, increasing pressure from invading peoples outside Roman culture contributed greatly to the collapse.\\n\\n**Key Events:**\\n- In 376 CE, a large migration of Goths and other non-Roman peoples, fleeing from the Huns, entered the Empire\\n- Roman forces were unable to exterminate, expel, or subjugate these groups as was their normal practice\\n- These non-Roman groups eventually became forces that could challenge the Empire itself\\n\\n**Historical Context:** The traditional Roman military superiority that had maintained control over vast territories for centuries was no longer sufficient to handle the scale and persistence of barbarian incursions.\\n\\n**Authoritative Reference:** *Fall of the Western Roman Empire*, Wikipedia. Retrieved 2024. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire\\n\\n### 2. Political Instability and Administrative Breakdown\\n\\n**The Cause:** The Empire suffered from incompetent leadership, internal struggles for power, and the breakdown of efficient civil administration. The political system that had once provided stability became a source of weakness.\\n\\n**Key Events:**\\n- In 395 CE, after winning two destructive civil wars, Emperor Theodosius I died\\n- He left behind a collapsing field army and an Empire divided between the warring ministers of his two incapable sons\\n- The division of the Empire between East and West created additional administrative challenges\\n\\n**Historical Context:** The competence of emperors and the efficiency of civil administration were crucial factors that historians identify as having deteriorated significantly during the Empire's final centuries.\\n\\n**Authoritative Reference:** *Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire*, Wikipedia. Retrieved 2024. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire\\n\\n### 3. Economic Decline and Demographic Crisis\\n\\n**The Cause:** The Roman Empire experienced significant economic weakening alongside demographic challenges, including population decline due to disease and other factors.\\n\\n**Key Factors:**\\n- Weakening of the overall economic strength that had supported the Empire's vast infrastructure\\n- Decline in the health and numbers of the Roman population\\n- Endemic and epidemic diseases that drove many of the immediate factors contributing to collapse\\n- Climatic changes that affected agricultural productivity and population stability\\n\\n**Historical Context:** The economic foundation that had supported Roman expansion and administration for centuries became insufficient to maintain the Empire's extensive territorial commitments and administrative needs.\\n\\n**Authoritative Reference:** *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* by Edward Gibbon (1776), as referenced in the historiographical literature. This foundational work introduced the systematic study of Roman decline and remains influential in modern scholarship.\\n\\n## Historiographical Perspective\\n\\nThe study of Rome's fall began in earnest with Edward Gibbon's seminal 1776 work \\\"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\\\" Though Gibbon was not the first to speculate about the Empire's collapse, he provided the first well-researched and well-referenced account, initiating an ongoing historiographical discussion that continues today.\\n\\nModern historians recognize that the fall was not a sudden event but rather a gradual process involving multiple interconnected factors. As noted by scholar Alexander Demandt in 1984, there are at least 210 different theories explaining Rome's fall, with new theories continuing to emerge as our understanding of the period evolves.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe fall of the Western Roman Empire resulted from a complex interplay of military, political, and economic factors rather than any single cause. The decline of military effectiveness, political instability with incompetent leadership, and economic weakness combined with demographic challenges created a perfect storm that even the mighty Roman Empire could not weather. Understanding these causes provides valuable insights not only into ancient history but also into the broader patterns of how complex civilizations can experience systemic failure.\\n\\nThe scholarly consensus emphasizes that this was a gradual transformation rather than a sudden collapse, with the traditional date of 476 CE marking not an abrupt end but rather the final acknowledgment of a process that had been unfolding for decades. This multifaceted approach to understanding Rome's fall continues to inform modern discussions about state failure and the sustainability of complex political systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*This article synthesizes information from authoritative historical sources and represents the current scholarly consensus on the primary causes of the Western Roman Empire's decline and fall.*\"}}",

Looking at the results, I can see there is one train that goes directly to Shanghai South (‰∏äÊµ∑Âçó):\n\n**D9** - This is the train that goes from Beijing South (VNP) to Shanghai South (SNH)\n\nLet me extract the key information for the earliest high-speed train option. From the search results, I can see that most trains go to Shanghai Hongqiao (‰∏äÊµ∑ËôπÊ°•) or Shanghai Station (‰∏äÊµ∑), but there is one train **D9** that goes directly to Shanghai South (‰∏äÊµ∑Âçó).\n\nBased on the search results for trains from Beijing South to Shanghai South on July 23, 2025:\n\n**For trains specifically going to Shanghai South (‰∏äÊµ∑Âçó):**\n- **Train D9**: Departure time 19:36, arrives at 08:00+1 (next day), duration 12:24\n  - Second-class sleeper: 544ÂÖÉ (available)\n  - Second-class seat: 362ÂÖÉ (available)  \n  - First-class sleeper: 689ÂÖÉ (available)\n\nHowever, I notice that D9 is not a high-speed train (it's a regular express train). If you specifically need a **high-speed train (G-series)**, all the high-speed trains from Beijing South go to either:\n- **Shanghai Hongqiao (‰∏äÊµ∑ËôπÊ°•)** - most trains\n- **Shanghai Station (‰∏äÊµ∑)** - some trains\n\n**The earliest high-speed train option would be:**\n- **Train G101**: Beijing South to Shanghai Hongqiao\n  - Departure time: **06:10**\n  - Arrival time: 12:09  \n  - Duration: 5:59\n  - **Ticket prices:**\n    - Business class: 2,318ÂÖÉ (3 tickets available)\n    - First class: 1,060ÂÖÉ (18 tickets available)\n    - Second class: **662ÂÖÉ** (tickets available)\n\nUnfortunately, there don't appear to be any high-speed trains (G-series) that go directly from Beijing South to Shanghai South station.

January 15, 2025 (Wednesday)**\n- **Lunar Date**: Áî≤Ëæ∞Âπ¥ÂçÅ‰∫åÊúàÂçÅÂÖ≠ (Dragon Year, 12th month, 16th day)\n- **Why it's excellent**: \"Â´ÅÂ®∂\" (marriage) is **explicitly listed as auspicious** (ÂÆú)\n- **Star Constellation**: ÁÆïÊ∞¥Ë±πÂêâ (Auspicious)\n- **Other favorable activities**: Opening business, travel, ceremonies, moving homes\n- **Avoid**: Bed arrangements, wood cutting, prayers for livestock\n\n### **2. January 22, 2025 (Wednesday)**  \n- **Lunar Date**: Áî≤Ëæ∞Âπ¥ÂçÅ‰∫åÊúàÂªø‰∏â (Dragon Year, 12th month, 23rd day)\n- **Why it's excellent**: \"Â´ÅÂ®∂\" (marriage) is **explicitly listed as auspicious** (ÂÆú)\n- **Star Constellation**: Â£ÅÊ∞¥ÁçùÂêâ (Auspicious)\n- **Other favorable activities**: Travel, business transactions, burial ceremonies\n- **Avoid**: Well digging, prayers, ground breaking, house construction\n\n### **3. February 12, 2025 (Wednesday) - Lantern Festival**\n- **Lunar Date**: ‰πôÂ∑≥Âπ¥Ê≠£ÊúàÂçÅ‰∫î (Snake Year, 1st month, 15th day) - **Lantern Festival**\n- **Why it's special**: \"Â´ÅÂ®∂\" (marriage) is listed as auspicious, **plus it's a traditional festival**\n- **Star Constellation**: ÁÆïÊ∞¥Ë±πÂêâ (Auspicious) \n- **Other favorable activities**: Prayers, blessing ceremonies, ground breaking, planting\n- **Avoid**: Moving into new homes, cooking, travel, livestock\n\n### **4. February 19, 2025 (Wednesday)**\n- **Lunar Date**: ‰πôÂ∑≥Âπ¥Ê≠£ÊúàÂªø‰∫å (Snake Year, 1st month, 22nd day)\n- **Why it's good**: \"Â´ÅÂ®∂\" (marriage) is listed as auspicious\n- **Star Constellation**: Â£ÅÊ∞¥ÁçùÂêâ (Auspicious)\n- **Other favorable activities**: Ground breaking, burial ceremonies\n- **Avoid**: Business openings, cooking, bed arrangements, home construction\n\n## **üìù Additional Notes:**\n\n1. **January 15th and 22nd** are particularly favorable as they fall in the Dragon Year (Áî≤Ëæ∞Âπ¥), which is considered very auspicious.\n\n2. **February 12th** is extra special as it coincides with the **Lantern Festival** (ÂÖÉÂÆµËäÇ), making it both auspicious according to the almanac and culturally significant.\n\n3. All dates show \"Â´ÅÂ®∂\" (marriage/wedding) explicitly listed in the \"ÂÆú\" (auspicious activities) section.\n\n4. The star constellations for all these dates are marked as \"Âêâ\" (auspicious).\n\nI recommend **January 15th or February 12th** as your top choices, with February 12th being especially meaningful due to the Lantern Festival celebration! üéä",
